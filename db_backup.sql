Even though a failing heart took him away from this world, his big loving heart will never be forgotten. We take comfort in the fact that he was surrounded by his family in his final moments. Cherished partner and best friend of Linda Tam. Adored father of Brayden. Beloved son of David and Hilda Proctor. Brother of David Proctor Jr. and his wife Sylvia. Loved Uncle of Nicole and Rachel.Dwayne was born and raised in Brantford. He attended BCI and St. John's College. He graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University where he studied Business and Economics. He eventually moved to Toronto where he began a career in the financial industry. Later in life, deciding on a career change, Dwayne attended University of Windsor where he received his Bachelor of Education. Ultimately, he went back to the financial industry where he worked for CIBC in Toronto for the past ten years. Dwayne was a man of many passions including: sports, travelling, music, cooking, and reading. He cared very deeply about nature and the environment. He took pride in trying to excel at every challenge he tackled in life, whether at work or in his personal life.Spending time with family was very important to Dwayne. He was a very caring person and loved his family more than anything. He understood that the quality of existence far exceeds the quantity of time in which one lives, so he always made time for family. He spent countless hours with Brayden playing tennis, soccer, baseball, hockey, skiing, bike riding, swimming, playing board games, jigsaw puzzles, crosswords, listening to music, and just having fun being silly together. His family is grateful to have had one last adventure with him on a recent canoe trip in Algonquin Park in Northern Ontario. Dwayne will be missed by the many families in the community as he was always so patient and kind with all the children, always including them in activities, and making sure everyone was treated fairly. Dwayne will be remembered by those who know and love him for his personality, dedication, generosity, wisdom and humility.

He was predeceased by his brother John and parents Gordon and Mary.Born in 1928 in Regina Saskatchewan, David was raised in Ottawa and attended Queens University, where he (the editor of the Queens Journal) met the beautiful and charming Peggy House (president of the Levana women's association). Legend has it that they tobogganed down a hill one winter evening and fell in love - the beginning of a 71-year partnership and series of adventures.David and Peggy were married in 1951, and immediately moved to Boston with the help of a small scholarship to the Harvard Business School. David worked hard, and supported by Peggy, obtained both MBA and DBA degrees from Harvard and was named Baker Scholar.Returning to Canada in 1956, David joined the fledgling business program at the University of Western Ontario, teaching marketing in the MBA and executive programs and helping found the PhD program. At age 28 he was younger than many of his students, some of whom became life-long business associates and friends. He was a prolific author and was especially proud of co-writing the first Canadian casebooks in Marketing with fellow professor Don Thain.His marketing expertise led to two year- long posts at the IMEDE business school in Lausanne Switzerland. He later taught at Harvard, Cambridge and other institutions and received honorary Doctorates from both Queens and the University of Windsor.David was elected President of the American Marketing Association in 1971 and then the International Marketing Association, the first Canadian to hold either post.An exciting opportunity arose in 1970 to combine his interests in management and music, and he became President of the Banff Centre for the Arts and Continuing Education. And so began a new adventure...The Leighton family moved west, and over the next thirteen years David helped transform the Banff Centre into an internationally - renowned institution. In collaboration with a great Board of Directors, he nurtured an extraordinary family of employees and artists. David was awarded the Alberta Order of Excellence in recognition of this major achievement.Although reluctant to leave Banff, David was asked to become President and CEO of the Organizing Committee for the Calgary Olympics in 1983. Over the next ten years he also became Chairman of Nabisco Brands and then Director of the National Centre for Management Research, all while serving on major corporate Boards. This governance experience resulted in influential publications such as Making Boards Work (with Don Thain in 1997), leading to David's recognition as a Fellow of the Institute of Canadian Directors.One constant throughout David's career was his love for the arts. An amateur violinist, he served on the Boards of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Canadian Conference of the Arts, International Bach Piano Competition, and was co-founder and Chair of the Banff Television Festival. This combination of arts and management experience was to lead to yet one more career.By 1999 David thought he had finally 'retired' with Peggy in London Ontario. It was a surprise when he received an invitation from Ottawa to become Chair of the National Arts Centre. The next seven years were, in his words, "a complete joy" as David worked with new President Peter Herrndorf and the Board to rebuild and enhance the Centre's reputation.This success and his leadership in the arts, business, and education led to David's appointment as an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2007.However - David's greatest pride was always his partnership with Peggy and their family. David and Peggy travelled the world and saw their five youngsters grow and succeed. Family get-togethers with children, partners and grandchildren at Logan Lake, Banff, Whistler, and around the world created life-long memories and bonds for all twenty-one family members.In 2018 David and Peggy moved back to the mountains they loved in Canmore. The family owes a debt of gratitude to the caring people at Origin Spring Creek, Dr. Emma Morin and the acute care team at the Canmore Hospital.David / Dad / Grandpa is remembered with love and admiration.He led a life worth celebrating and set an example worth emulating.He was a great Canadian.Recognition of David's life can be made by contributions to Leighton Artist Studios at the Banff Centre:https://www.banffcentre.ca/support-us/donateCondolences for the family may be sent to:www.bowriverfuneral.com.

She is survived by her husband of 19 years, Allan Conway, and her children and their families: Jan (Francis Scarpaleggia), Caroline (Kevin Van Hullebush), Matthew (Maude), and Adam, as well as granddaughters Mia, Caroline, Isabel, and Grace. Joanne was pre-deceased by her parents, Christine and Alan, and is survived by her siblings and their families: Christopher (Darla), John, Jamie, and Kathy (Mike Kampmann).Joanne was always grateful for the interesting work she had in her career at CBC Radio, the University of Calgary, and the University of Windsor where she spent six years teaching before her retirement in 2015.Joanne would have been an incredible interior designer. She loved beautiful interiors, architecture, art, and also books, movies, nachos and wine. But what she loved most—and what was most fulfilling to her—were her four children who are all unique, caring individuals. She was proud of each one.In recent years, Joanne greatly enjoyed many memorable trips with Allan to London, Paris, the Maritimes, New York, Phoenix, Hawaii, and Cabo San Lucas. They shared a great love of movies, good television, and poring over the weekend newspapers.Another special part of life that Joanne always looked forward to was spending time with her siblings and their families at reunions and weddings. She loved them all very much and treasured the bond they shared.Everyone who knew Joanne will forever miss her enthusiasm, humour, intelligence, perseverance, and her cooking (especially her tuna fish pizza, peanut butter-raspberry jam cookies, and banana-blueberry pancakes on a Sunday morning). We will never forget her fun-loving nature as Granny Nanny after school or as Gramma-rama setting up backyard adventures for her granddaughters that featured a riding ring for Whinny and Blackberry the stick horses, and many large animal sprinklers. And the fun continued in Windsor with the exciting boating and swimming adventures she organized for her granddaughters at Lake St. Clair.Joanne was a conversationalist and the best listener—she could strike up an instant conversation with anyone she met, and her charisma filled the room. When she was not reading a book, she would usually be sharing a great discussion with her family, a friend, or someone she had just met.Joanne was pre-deceased by her first husband, Russell Ramsay, and she wished to echo his sentiment to: "Remember the good times—there were so many".The family would like to thank the wonderful staff at Foothills Medical Centre especially Dr. Jennifer Grossman and the nurses at the Alberta Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinic, Dr. Stuart Hutchison, and the nurses and staff at the Libin Cardiovascular Institute.A private family gathering will take place at a later time.

He obtained a B.A. (Gold Medalist) and M.A. in Psychology from the University of Windsor and his Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology from the University of Western Ontario in 1970 before moving to Calgary to join the faculty at the fledgling University of Calgary. Over time he became a true Westerner and considered Calgary his home (except when his beloved Red Wings were playing at the Saddledome).Dr. Mosley, as he was known on campus, taught for many years in the Psychology Department at the University of Calgary before retiring as Emeritus Professor in 1997. He was a kind and compassionate person and devoted his time and energy to little ones who need a helping hand, lecturing on child development at the University, supervising graduate students in research and applied settings, and serving as a long-standing member on many charitable boards and organizations, including Vecova (formerly VRRI) and the Providence Child Development Centre. He worked as a financial consultant after he retired from the University but continued to be involved with Vecova and the Providence Child Development Centre for many years until recently.Lary, Uncle Lary, or just plain "DaDeo", as he was more commonly known to family and friends, was a man of many talents. He had a seemingly endless supply of puns and malapropisms, some of which were even funny, and a wonderful singing voice. He knew the words of every song or could improvise with impunity and harmonize with the best of them from years of singing in church and with a CYO quartet in his youth. A special memento and highlight of many family weddings is the original song composed and sung by Uncle Lary, with accompanying disc and picture of the smiling couple.Lary was also a good athlete. He played football and softball and ran hurdles in track and field in high school and university. An injury to his knee playing touch football in a cow pasture cut short his athletic career but he was still a person to be reckoned with in the weight room or in the stands at Heather and Matthew's sporting events and Flames Games where Lary was always a loud and enthusiastic fan.Most of all, Lary loved people and was genuinely interested in what was happening in their lives. He was open and accepting of everyone and always willing to listen to your troubles or lend a helping hand. His family received special attention and will miss his smiling face and loving attention on a daily basis.Lary was predeceased by his mother and father, George and Margaret Mosley of Windsor, ON, sister and brother-in-law, Helen and John Gignac of Brampton, ON, and brother-in-law and close friend, Stuart van der Lee of Calgary, AB. He will be sorely missed and fondly remembered by his wife Jean van der Lee of Calgary, AB, daughter Heather (Malcolm) Wallace of Coquitlam, BC, son Matthew (Lauren McAlpine) Mosley of Perth, AU, his former wife Sheila Blair-Mosley, daughter Krista Mosley and sister Margo Bruce, all of Windsor, ON, and his very special grandchildren, Ava Grace Mosley of Perth, AU and Henderson James Wallace of Coquitlam, BC as well as his sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law, Marilyn and Richard Keevil (Deep Cove, BC), David and Kathleen van der Lee (Calgary, AB), Joyceanne and Laurie Smith (Calgary, AB), John and Sharon van der Lee (Strathmore, AB), Bill and Lorna van der Lee (Calgary, AB), Bruce van der Lee and Henry Soto Salas (Grecia, Costa Rica), Shirley van der Lee (Rob Devido) (Calgary, AB) and Katrina van der Lee (Calgary, AB), and numerous nieces, nephews, extended family members, friends, and colleagues.Those wishing to pay their respects may do so at McInnis & Holloway (Park Memorial, 5008 Elbow Drive SW, Calgary, AB) on Thursday August 1, 2024 from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.Funeral Mass will be celebrated at St. Anthony's Catholic Church (5340 – 4th Street SW, Calgary, AB) on Friday August 2, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Graveside Service to follow at Eden Brook Cemetery (24223 Township Rd 242, Calgary, AB).

As a small boy, Tim was a hard worker and eager to help. He enjoyed fishing and rowdy games of street hockey with his brother, and had a great curiosity for how things worked. As a young man he developed a knack for taking things apart and fixing them-everyone knew to bring him anything that was broken, knowing it'd be as good as new. At the University of Windsor, Tim earned a degree in Computer Science as well as Engineering, and was a member of Mensa. He went on to apply his skills with great success. Soon he met Patricia Smith, a lively young woman who shared his love of adventure, and they married. Over time, Tim worked as a software developer and then found his niche as a functional manager for technology companies Nortel and SMART, where he enjoyed mentoring. Finding great pride in workmanship, Tim maintained a beautiful home, spending many hours in the vegetable garden and yard. He and his wife loved their quirky dogs and were always ready to take in a stray. When Pat's health declined, he took care of her while she received a kidney transplant. Some of their favourite memories together were spent watching classic movies and gardening. It was in Alberta that Tim discovered a love of hiking. He summited challenging peaks and scaled ridges, taking in expansive views while seeking out wild and beautiful places. His adventures and stories reflected his passion and it was in the mountains where he was happiest. Tim was predeceased by his father and brothers Fred and Randy. He is survived by his wife Pat, daughter Lindsay and son-in-law Michael, their three children; and his mother, sister Gayle, brother George, nieces and nephews and grandnieces and nephews. Tim will be remembered for the help he offered family and friends, and the adventurous spirit that was such a great part of him.		t	NULL	NULL	51.05	-114.085

He was born and raised in Victoria, the fifth of six children of John and Constance Lawless. David graduated from St. Louis College in Victoria in 1949 where he was particularly interested in drama and theatre. Soon afterwards he contemplated a priestly life in the Roman Catholic Church and entered the seminary at Assumption College in Windsor. Shortly before taking his final vows David decided to change his direction in life and instead pursued graduate studies in social psychology. Simultaneously, while proceeding with his post-secondary education, he was employed in jobs as diverse as roofing, working in a ship-yard, prospecting, and as an immigration officer for the Foreign Service at the Canadian High Commission in London, England from 1960 to 1963. David met his beloved wife Maria Pilar Ruiz Campuzano from Spain while studying in Vancouver. Shortly afterwards, they married in 1958 and began raising a family. As well as being devoted to his family, he dedicated most of his professional life to post-secondary education, particularly the promotion and enhancement of Catholic post-secondary education in Canada. Throughout David's extensive life and journeys he also lived, studied, and worked in Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Madrid, Spain, Antigonish, N.S., and finally in Calgary. Through his wife Maria Pilar and her family, he developed a close bond and love for Spain, living there at times as well as visiting and vacationing with family. Among his numerous academic accomplishments, David received a B.A. from Assumption College, University of Windsor, a M.A. from the University of British Columbia, a second M.A. from The University of London (UK), and also a Ph.D. from the University of London. In his extensive career with colleges and universities in Canada from 1963 onward, David held the following academic and administrative positions: Professor of Psychology, University of Manitoba; Dean of St. John's College, UofM; Associate Dean of Arts, UofM; Dean of Continuing Education, UofM; Vice President (Academic) UofM; Rector of St. Pauls's College, UofM; President of St. Francis Xavier University; and lastly President of St. Mary's University, Calgary until his retirement in 1999. Throughout his many world travels and work he was associated with numerous organizations that promoted world development and education, particularly the IDRC, (now CIDA), the Coady International Institute, and in his final months the Science Spirituality Health Research Institute in Calgary. David travelled extensively as part of his academic career and met with presidents, prime ministers and popes. He was especially fortunate to have twice had an audience with St. John Paul II, and also meet with St. Teresa of Calcutta. David was also an accomplished writer, and amongst the numerous academic papers he published he wrote two texts on Organizational Behaviour in the 1970's and 80's. In his final years he also became a passionate writer of fiction, and one of his short stories, "My Father/My Husband" was published in the journals Prism International and Best American Essays in 2012. It is now being adapted for the stage in New York. A member of the Calgary Ranchman's Club upon moving to Calgary in 1996, he especially enjoyed playing bridge there and made numerous close friends and acquaintances. An avid gardener throughout his life, David often found pleasure and relaxation working in his garden. He was especially proud of the wide variety of vegetables he always managed to grow in Canada's often unforgiving weather. He was predeceased by his loving wife of 52 years, Maria Pilar, in 2010. David is survived by his six children (David [Lynn] in Chelsea, Quebec, John [Alice] in Richmond BC, Andrew [Freda] in Raleigh, NC, Jose-Ignacio in Calgary, Denise [Keith] in Hamilton, and Daniel in Calgary), seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. He is also survived by his sister Velma and brother Brian in Victoria. David also leaves behind numerous extended family and friends throughout Canada (particularly in Victoria), and also in Spain.

Like many other trips, this one also led him to help someone.Welcomed into the world on March 1, 1980, he immediately gave blissful joy to his parents, Baljinder Singh and Sukhvir Kaur Bhullar, his grandparents, Jagir Singh and Mohinder Kaur Bhullar and Late Ram Singh and Late Gurdev Kaur Shergill.He easily eclipsed his older sister Tarjinder's prominence in the family. A few years later, he said hello to his younger brother Appy, who would become his lifelong right hand man.His aunts and uncles from the Bhullar, Shergill, Lail, Sekhon, and Sidhu family, showered him with love.His cousins Amardeep (Sukhi), Tammy (Sanjay), Parabhdeep, Sonny (Nisha), Shannon (Inder), Sam, Dilpreet (Balcharan), Jasleen, Sundeep, Sharon, Simran, Karen, Harmol, Rabina, Jagmeet, Hamreet, Anmol, Arvinder, Aman (Stacey), and Raman, gave him endless love and laughter.His friends, who if named here would leave little room for any other stories in today's paper, were synonymous with family.Growing up he played hockey on the streets and driveways of Whitehorn and dabbled in tae kwon do, where he mastered skills less and dramatic poses more. He had entrepreneurial spirit, with a lawnmower and cousins in tow. A proud northeast boy, he never forgot about his time at Chief Justice Milvain Elementary and Annie Gale Junior High. The only time you didn't prominently see him with his turban, was when he put on a helmet to play High School football at Lester B. Pearson High School.He didn't fancy himself as an academic, yet somehow he went on to get his Bachelors in Sociology, beginning it at the Mount Royal University and completing it from the University of Athabasca. Later while MLA, he obtained his Law Degree from the University of Windsor. He was the first to encourage others to pursue further education.It was a chance meeting at an evening Punjabi class 13 years ago, where he attended as a guest speaker, that Namrita Rattan entered his life. The rest, as they say, is history. In some ways their relationship defied logic. In every way it showed you that real love means having an unabiding faith in one another, matched with patience and humour. On January 7, 2012, they became husband and wife. Her parents, Dalbir Singh and Kiran Kaur Rattan, sister Sushana (Jason), and brother Harsimer, welcomed him as a son and brother long before the wedding.Manmeet welcomed another sister into his life when Appy married Amrit in 2013.The relationship that guided him most was the one he shared with God. Sikhism gave him the convictions of seva (selfless work), equality for all, and the responsibility of sharing the sorrow of others as if they are your own.Manmeet served his community and championed causes long before he entered politics and would have done so long after he left. He was and always would have been a public servant.He was the light in our lives.Meeta, it was not only #nicetomanmeetyou, it was an absolute honour.A State Memorial Service, open to the public, will be held for Manmeet at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium (1415 - 14 Avenue NW, Calgary) on Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 12:00 p.m. Visitation will be from 9:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m.In lieu of flowers we kindly request you make a donation in his memory to the Sheldon Kennedy Child Advocacy Centre atwww.sheldonkennedycac.ca.

Mike and his wife, Sheila, have 3 children, Kayla, Megan and Emily; Kevin has a daughter, Abigail; and Jenny (Jeremy) has a daughter Teagan. Ron is also survived by Darleen's children, Donald and Lori (Harvey); and by Ron's sister, Linda (Neil), as well as nieces and nephews. Ron was predeceased by his parents, Reg and Doris, a number of years ago. When Ron wasn't at work, he was watching his grandchildren at soccer games; and, if it wasn't soccer, Darleen and Ron could be found on the golf course. Ron was a "closet" car buff: while burning the midnight oil during tax season, he would scour Kijiji and Auto Trader for his next ride. By April 30, a gently used vehicle would be found in his garage. Ironically, it was only six months ago that Ron purchased his first new car. In celebration of Ron's life, Funeral Services will be held at Eden Brook Memorial Gardens & Funeral Home (located at the intersection of 17 Avenue SW and Lower Springbank Road) on Wednesday, August 5, 2015 at 11:00 a.m. In lieu of flowers, if so desired, donations in Ron's memory may be made to the Heart & Stroke Foundation, 100 - 119 14 Street NW, Calgary, Alberta T2N 1Z6.

Like many other trips, this one also led him to help someone. Welcomed into the world on March 1, 1980, he immediately gave blissful joy to his parents, Baljinder Singh and Sukhvir Kaur Bhullar, his grandparents, Jagir Singh and Mohinder Kaur Bhullar and Late Ram Singh and Late Gurdev Kaur Shergill. He easily eclipsed his older sister Tarjinder’s prominence in the family. A few years later, he said hello to his younger brother Appy, who would become his lifelong right hand man. His aunts and uncles from the Bhullar, Shergill, Lail, Sekhon, and Sidhu family, showered him with love. His cousins Amardeep (Sukhi), Tammy (Sanjay), Parabhdeep, Sonny (Nisha), Shannon (Inder), Sam, Dilpreet (Balcharan), Jasleen, Sundeep, Sharon, Simran, Karen, Harmol, Rabina, Jagmeet, Hamreet, Anmol, Arvinder, Aman (Stacey), and Raman, gave him endless love and laughter. His friends, who if named here would leave little room for any other stories in today’s paper, were synonymous with family. Growing up he played hockey on the streets and driveways of Whitehorn and dabbled in tae kwon do, where he mastered skills less and dramatic poses more. He had entrepreneurial spirit, with a lawnmower and cousins in tow. A proud northeast boy, he never forgot about his time at Chief Justice Milvain Elementary and Annie Gale Junior High. The only time you didn’t prominently see him with his turban, was when he put on a helmet to play High School football at Lester B. Pearson High School. He didn’t fancy himself as an academic, yet somehow he went on to get his Bachelors in Sociology, beginning it at the Mount Royal University and completing it from the University of Athabasca. Later while MLA, he obtained his Law Degree from the University of Windsor. He was the first to encourage others to pursue further education. It was a chance meeting at an evening Punjabi class thirteen years ago, where he attended as a guest speaker, that Namrita Rattan entered his life. The rest, as they say, is history. In some ways their relationship defied logic. In every way it showed you that real love means having an unabiding faith in one another, matched with patience and humour. On January 7, 2012, they became husband and wife. Her parents, Dalbir Singh and Kiran Kaur Rattan, sister Sushana (Jason), and brother Harsimer, welcomed him as a son and brother long before the wedding. Manmeet welcomed another sister into his life when Appy married Amrit in 2013. The relationship that guided him most was the one he shared with God. Sikhism gave him the convictions of seva (selfless work), equality for all, and the responsibility of sharing the sorrow of others as if they are your own.  Manmeet served his community and championed causes long before he entered politics and would have done so long after he left. He was and always would have been a public servant.  He was the light in our lives.   Meeta, it was not only #nicetomanmeetyou, it was an absolute honour.  A State Memorial Service, open to the public, will be held for Manmeet at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium (1415 - 14 Avenue N.W., Calgary) on Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 12:00 p.m. Visitation will be from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. In lieu of flowers we kindly request you make a donation in his memory to the Sheldon Kennedy Child Advocacy Centre atwww.sheldonkennedycac.ca.

A first generation Canadian, Ed was born in Toronto following the emigration of his parents from the Netherlands and spent his childhood in Windsor, Ontario. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree (1971) in psychology and a Bachelor of Laws degree (1976) from the University of Windsor. After graduation, Ed made his way to Calgary along with three friends and classmates - Noel O'Brien, Q.C., Brian Devlin, Q.C. and Tim Williamson (now of Vancouver) in an infamous U-haul caravan drive - to Calgary in what he fondly described as the "Windsor Mafia" of law grads accumulating in the Calgary area at that time. Ed articled with the Calgary law firm, Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer (BD&P) under the guidance of (now Mr. Justice) John Rooke who became a close, life-long friend. Ed was admitted to the Alberta Bar in 1977 following which he continued on with BD&P practising primarily corporate securities law for the next ten years. He joined the partnership of BD&P in 1981 and then completed a two-year assignment with the firm's international office in London, England. After returning to Calgary, Ed established a commodity trading firm providing hedging programs and trading services to junior oil and gas operators. This complex world of options and trading strategy was always of keen interest to Ed's analytical mind, an interest which continued throughout his life. In 1989, Ed joined the Calgary law firm of McCaffery Goss as a securities and corporate lawyer. In 1993, he wrote a well-regarded technical book "Broker's Liability: Emergence and Avoidance", now in its twelfth printing, which for several years was required reading for the Canadian Securities Institute course for brokers and registered representatives. From 1993 through 2001 Ed was a sole practitioner in securities and corporate finance for junior energy and mining companies. He served on the boards of several public and private companies and was founder and CEO of several successful oil and gas drilling funds. Ed's fondness for travel and interest in business and finance took him to Doha, Qatar in 2001, where he joined the partnership of Gebran Majdalany, a major international law firm. His work focussed on the financing, structure and closing of many major deals between companies, their lenders, and the Qatari government. He also acted as local counsel for numerous international law firms doing business in Qatar. In mid 2007, he joined Qatari Diar, an investment arm of Qatar Investment Authority. During the time Ed resided in Calgary, he enjoyed time spent in the Windermere Valley, B.C., and was an avid alpine skier. He greatly enjoyed scuba diving and had achieved the Dive Master (Padi) designation in the mid 1980s. His diving log book records time spent underwater in numerous exotic locations. Ed had recently returned to Calgary for an extended visit with old friends when he fell suddenly ill. In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by his only sibling, Margo Van der Touw (husband, David Sinclair) of Terrace, British Columbia; two nephews, Benjamin and Dominic Salopek of Vancouver, numerous extended family members in Ontario and the Netherlands, many friends in Alberta, Ontario and overseas. He was predeceased by his father Nicolaas in 1999 and his mother Rie in 2002. A celebration of Ed's life will be held on Monday, April 28 at the Ranchmen's Club at 710 - 13 Avenue S.W. at 2:30 p.m. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that donations be made to the "Edward Vink Baby Fund", at any branch of CIBC worldwide.

It is difficult to summarize a life in just a few sentences. Leo believed that there had to be one more miracle out there that he could claim and we marveled at how he fought the cancer with dignity and determination but was totally at peace with God's will. Leo was born in Leamington, Ontario to Arthur and Anna Bouckhout, their only child. Leo completed his first degree in Biology at the University of Windsor; Masters degree in Environmental Science from the University of Calgary; Executive Development from Banff School of Management. Leo started his career at Lombard North, an environmental consulting firm in Calgary. That is where he met Nadine and they married in June, 1974. Leo's environmental career continued at Foothills Pipe Lines, Husky Oil, Canadian Petroleum Association, and E2 Environmental Alliance. In 2002 he joined Matrix Solutions where he was Vice President - International Division until his passing. Since 1992 Leo completed more than fifty consulting and training assignments worldwide for industrial clients, foreign governments and international financial institutions. His work took him to more than twenty countries on five continents. They have two wonderful children, Nicole born in 1977 and David in 1980. Nicole has his love for chocolates, shopping and his attention to detail; David has his skills of good financial management and his passion for cars. There are so many things that we will miss about Leo; his laugh, his positive attitude on life reminding us that "we have to play the hand that God dealt", and his unconditional love for his family. Leo will be joining his Mom and Dad in eternity with the precious Lord Jesus. He will be remembered by his wife Nadine; daughter Nicole and her husband Colin Schieman and granddaughter Ruby Schieman; son David. He will also be remembered by family in Saskatoon - mother-in-law Pauline Bodnar, Walter Bodnar and family, Ernie and Bernice Bodnar, and Darlene Bodnar. All of Leo's extended family reside in Belgium and Holland. There are so many people to thank for their support and encouragement; the Foothills Medical Centre (Unit 61), Kevin Huntley, Dr. J. Simon; friends who have touched our hearts forever with the kindness they showed to Leo and to our family; the "care group" from First Alliance Church; and to Pastor Ray Matheson for his prayers and many visits.

An internationally recognized expert on concrete, Cameron's research was supported over many years by grants from the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and resulted in numerous scientific articles. He and former student, Dr. Norbert Becker, received the prestigious Wason Medal for Materials Research of the American Concrete Institute in 1975, for the best paper of the year in that field. In recognition of his outstanding contributions to engineering science Cameron was made a Life Member and Fellow of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineering, a Fellow of the American Concrete Institute, and a Fellow of the Engineering Institute of Canada. However, what gave him the greatest pleasure were the accomplishments of his students. Cameron also distinguished himself in professional and community service. He was a referee for numerous scholarly journals and for NSERC and the National Research Council of Canada, a member of various technical committees of the Canadian Standards Association and the American Concrete Institute, and Chairman of the Board of the Border Cities Branch of the Engineering Institute of Canada. He served on the University of Windsor Senate and Board of Governors, the Council of Ontario Universities, the Board of Directors of the London Goodenough Association of Canada, and the Board of Windsor's Metropolitan Hospital. Cameron manifested his strong commitment to human rights through membership in Amnesty International and as an envoy of the First Unitarian Church, Toronto, to the United Nations NGO. Cameron's life was enriched by his love of art, music, and theatre. He was a voracious reader and a wonderful conversationalist. He travelled extensively, with favourite destinations being Great Britain and Nova Scotia. Cameron had a delightful and often mischievous sense of humour. His gregarious nature was a hallmark of who he was. He was comfortable in any social situation and had a marvellous capacity to put others at ease. A man of high principles and great integrity, he was exemplary in his loyalty and devotion to family and friends. Cameron will be remembered as a true gentleman, and is held in the greatest respect and affection by all who were so very fortunate to know him. A celebration of Cameron's life will be held on Saturday, September 15, 2007 at 2:00 p.m. at the First Unitarian Church, 175 St. Clair Avenue West, Toronto.

His great love of life, expansive spirit and sense of humour touched everyone who knew him. Rene was born May 12, 1935 in Leeuwarden, in the Dutch province of Frysland. He spent much of the German occupation of Holland on the Harmsma farm in Joure, Holland. Rene's secondary education began with a degree in Hotel Management in Holland. Continuing his studies in Canada, he earned his M.B.A. from the University of Windsor in Ontario. Rene married Claudette Demers and had two daughters, Gabrielle and Nadine. The family later moved to Alberta where he worked as District Manager of Versafood Services. Rene's life took an unexpected turn in the mid-seventies, while looking for fossils. After coming across the little known fossilized gemstone Ammolite, Rene traded his chef's cap for a white cotton slouch hat and took to fossil-hunting full time. Rene developed and owned the Natural History Museum in Banff until 1981. Korite was purchased in 1979 with partners James Rae and Bill Jarvis. Pierre Pare and Wilson Yip joined the partnership and together they built Korite Minerals. They started Canada Fossils in 1985. Rene was instrumental in having Ammolite recognized as a gemstone, marketing it worldwide. For his accomplishments he was awarded the Alberta Centennial Medal in 2005. Rene married Shelley Vollans in Banff in 1986. They loved scuba diving. Together they traveled the world, diving in such remote spots as Tonga and Malaysia. Shelley was a strong and loving supporter of Rene throughout his long illness. Shelley retired from her career as a Speech Pathologist to spend more time with Rene in his remaining years. Rene enjoyed cooking. He was a lover of fine food and wines, and an active member of the Chaine des Rotisseurs. An avid outdoorsman and fitness fanatic, Rene loved to swim, scuba dive, sail, cross country ski, hike, jog and bicycle. He had a great love for the arts and was passionate about classical music. He was a spirited bridge player and keen collector of antique silver. Rene is survived by his loving wife, Shelley Vandervelde; his daughters, Gabrielle and her spouse Jill Wigle; and Nadine and son-in-law Scott Kraft; granddaughters, Gabrielle and Beatrice; sister Betty Porteous; their extended families, and a very large circle of friends and business associates.

He was predeceased by his brother John and parents Gordon and Mary.Born in 1928 in Regina Saskatchewan, David was raised in Ottawa and attended Queens University, where he (the editor of the Queens Journal) met the beautiful and charming Peggy House (president of the Levana women's association). Legend has it that they tobogganed down a hill one winter evening and fell in love - the beginning of a 71-year partnership and series of adventures.David and Peggy were married in 1951, and immediately moved to Boston with the help of a small scholarship to the Harvard Business School. David worked hard, and supported by Peggy, obtained both MBA and DBA degrees from Harvard and was named Baker Scholar.Returning to Canada in 1956, David joined the fledgling business program at the University of Western Ontario, teaching marketing in the MBA and executive programs and helping found the PhD program. At age 28 he was younger than many of his students, some of whom became life-long business associates and friends. He was a prolific author and was especially proud of co-writing the first Canadian casebooks in Marketing with fellow professor Don Thain.His marketing expertise led to two year- long posts at the IMEDE business school in Lausanne Switzerland. He later taught at Harvard, Cambridge and other institutions and received honorary Doctorates from both Queens and the University of Windsor.David was elected President of the American Marketing Association in 1971 and then the International Marketing Association, the first Canadian to hold either post.An exciting opportunity arose in 1970 to combine his interests in management and music, and he became President of the Banff Centre for the Arts and Continuing Education. And so began a new adventure...The Leighton family moved west, and over the next thirteen years David helped transform the Banff Centre into an internationally - renowned institution. In collaboration with a great Board of Directors, he nurtured an extraordinary family of employees and artists. David was awarded the Alberta Order of Excellence in recognition of this major achievement.Although reluctant to leave Banff, David was asked to become President and CEO of the Organizing Committee for the Calgary Olympics in 1983. Over the next ten years he also became Chairman of Nabisco Brands and then Director of the National Centre for Management Research, all while serving on major corporate Boards. This governance experience resulted in influential publications such as Making Boards Work (with Don Thain in 1997), leading to David's recognition as a Fellow of the Institute of Canadian Directors.One constant throughout David's career was his love for the arts. An amateur violinist, he served on the Boards of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Canadian Conference of the Arts, International Bach Piano Competition, and was co-founder and Chair of the Banff Television Festival. This combination of arts and management experience was to lead to yet one more career.By 1999 David thought he had finally 'retired' with Peggy in London Ontario. It was a surprise when he received an invitation from Ottawa to become Chair of the National Arts Centre. The next seven years were, in his words, "a complete joy" as David worked with new President Peter Herrndorf and the Board to rebuild and enhance the Centre's reputation.This success and his leadership in the arts, business, and education led to David's appointment as an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2007.However - David's greatest pride was always his partnership with Peggy and their family. David and Peggy travelled the world and saw their five youngsters grow and succeed. Family get-togethers with children, partners and grandchildren at Logan Lake, Banff, Whistler, and around the world created life-long memories and bonds for all twenty-one family members.In 2018 David and Peggy moved back to the mountains they loved in Canmore. The family owes a debt of gratitude to the caring people at Origin Spring Creek, Dr. Emma Morin and the acute care team at the Canmore Hospital.David / Dad / Grandpa is remembered with love and admiration.He led a life worth celebrating and set an example worth emulating.He was a great Canadian.Recognition of David's life can be made by contributions to Leighton Artist Studios at the Banff Centre:https://www.banffcentre.ca/support-us/donateCondolences for the family may be sent to:www.bowriverfuneral.com.

She is survived by her husband of 19 years, Allan Conway, and her children and their families: Jan (Francis Scarpaleggia), Caroline (Kevin Van Hullebush), Matthew (Maude), and Adam, as well as granddaughters Mia, Caroline, Isabel, and Grace. Joanne was pre-deceased by her parents, Christine and Alan, and is survived by her siblings and their families: Christopher (Darla), John, Jamie, and Kathy (Mike Kampmann).Joanne was always grateful for the interesting work she had in her career at CBC Radio, the University of Calgary, and the University of Windsor where she spent six years teaching before her retirement in 2015.Joanne would have been an incredible interior designer. She loved beautiful interiors, architecture, art, and also books, movies, nachos and wine. But what she loved most—and what was most fulfilling to her—were her four children who are all unique, caring individuals. She was proud of each one.In recent years, Joanne greatly enjoyed many memorable trips with Allan to London, Paris, the Maritimes, New York, Phoenix, Hawaii, and Cabo San Lucas. They shared a great love of movies, good television, and poring over the weekend newspapers.Another special part of life that Joanne always looked forward to was spending time with her siblings and their families at reunions and weddings. She loved them all very much and treasured the bond they shared.Everyone who knew Joanne will forever miss her enthusiasm, humour, intelligence, perseverance, and her cooking (especially her tuna fish pizza, peanut butter-raspberry jam cookies, and banana-blueberry pancakes on a Sunday morning). We will never forget her fun-loving nature as Granny Nanny after school or as Gramma-rama setting up backyard adventures for her granddaughters that featured a riding ring for Whinny and Blackberry the stick horses, and many large animal sprinklers. And the fun continued in Windsor with the exciting boating and swimming adventures she organized for her granddaughters at Lake St. Clair.Joanne was a conversationalist and the best listener—she could strike up an instant conversation with anyone she met, and her charisma filled the room. When she was not reading a book, she would usually be sharing a great discussion with her family, a friend, or someone she had just met.Joanne was pre-deceased by her first husband, Russell Ramsay, and she wished to echo his sentiment to: "Remember the good times—there were so many".The family would like to thank the wonderful staff at Foothills Medical Centre especially Dr. Jennifer Grossman and the nurses at the Alberta Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinic, Dr. Stuart Hutchison, and the nurses and staff at the Libin Cardiovascular Institute.A private family gathering will take place at a later time.

He obtained a B.A. (Gold Medalist) and M.A. in Psychology from the University of Windsor and his Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology from the University of Western Ontario in 1970 before moving to Calgary to join the faculty at the fledgling University of Calgary. Over time he became a true Westerner and considered Calgary his home (except when his beloved Red Wings were playing at the Saddledome).Dr. Mosley, as he was known on campus, taught for many years in the Psychology Department at the University of Calgary before retiring as Emeritus Professor in 1997. He was a kind and compassionate person and devoted his time and energy to little ones who need a helping hand, lecturing on child development at the University, supervising graduate students in research and applied settings, and serving as a long-standing member on many charitable boards and organizations, including Vecova (formerly VRRI) and the Providence Child Development Centre. He worked as a financial consultant after he retired from the University but continued to be involved with Vecova and the Providence Child Development Centre for many years until recently.Lary, Uncle Lary, or just plain "DaDeo", as he was more commonly known to family and friends, was a man of many talents. He had a seemingly endless supply of puns and malapropisms, some of which were even funny, and a wonderful singing voice. He knew the words of every song or could improvise with impunity and harmonize with the best of them from years of singing in church and with a CYO quartet in his youth. A special memento and highlight of many family weddings is the original song composed and sung by Uncle Lary, with accompanying disc and picture of the smiling couple.Lary was also a good athlete. He played football and softball and ran hurdles in track and field in high school and university. An injury to his knee playing touch football in a cow pasture cut short his athletic career but he was still a person to be reckoned with in the weight room or in the stands at Heather and Matthew's sporting events and Flames Games where Lary was always a loud and enthusiastic fan.Most of all, Lary loved people and was genuinely interested in what was happening in their lives. He was open and accepting of everyone and always willing to listen to your troubles or lend a helping hand. His family received special attention and will miss his smiling face and loving attention on a daily basis.Lary was predeceased by his mother and father, George and Margaret Mosley of Windsor, ON, sister and brother-in-law, Helen and John Gignac of Brampton, ON, and brother-in-law and close friend, Stuart van der Lee of Calgary, AB.

He was born and raised in Victoria, the fifth of six children of John and Constance Lawless. David graduated from St. Louis College in Victoria in 1949 where he was particularly interested in drama and theatre. Soon afterwards he contemplated a priestly life in the Roman Catholic Church and entered the seminary at Assumption College in Windsor. Shortly before taking his final vows David decided to change his direction in life and instead pursued graduate studies in social psychology. Simultaneously, while proceeding with his post-secondary education, he was employed in jobs as diverse as roofing, working in a ship-yard, prospecting, and as an immigration officer for the Foreign Service at the Canadian High Commission in London, England from 1960 to 1963. David met his beloved wife Maria Pilar Ruiz Campuzano from Spain while studying in Vancouver. Shortly afterwards, they married in 1958 and began raising a family. As well as being devoted to his family, he dedicated most of his professional life to post-secondary education, particularly the promotion and enhancement of Catholic post-secondary education in Canada. Throughout David's extensive life and journeys he also lived, studied, and worked in Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Madrid, Spain, Antigonish, N.S., and finally in Calgary. Through his wife Maria Pilar and her family, he developed a close bond and love for Spain, living there at times as well as visiting and vacationing with family. Among his numerous academic accomplishments, David received a B.A. from Assumption College, University of Windsor, a M.A. from the University of British Columbia, a second M.A. from The University of London (UK), and also a Ph.D. from the University of London. In his extensive career with colleges and universities in Canada from 1963 onward, David held the following academic and administrative positions: Professor of Psychology, University of Manitoba; Dean of St. John's College, UofM; Associate Dean of Arts, UofM; Dean of Continuing Education, UofM; Vice President (Academic) UofM; Rector of St. Pauls's College, UofM; President of St. Francis Xavier University; and lastly President of St. Mary's University, Calgary until his retirement in 1999. Throughout his many world travels and work he was associated with numerous organizations that promoted world development and education, particularly the IDRC, (now CIDA), the Coady International Institute, and in his final months the Science Spirituality Health Research Institute in Calgary. David travelled extensively as part of his academic career and met with presidents, prime ministers and popes. He was especially fortunate to have twice had an audience with St. John Paul II, and also meet with St. Teresa of Calcutta. David was also an accomplished writer, and amongst the numerous academic papers he published he wrote two texts on Organizational Behaviour in the 1970's and 80's. In his final years he also became a passionate writer of fiction, and one of his short stories, "My Father/My Husband" was published in the journals Prism International and Best American Essays in 2012. It is now being adapted for the stage in New York. A member of the Calgary Ranchman's Club upon moving to Calgary in 1996, he especially enjoyed playing bridge there and made numerous close friends and acquaintances. An avid gardener throughout his life, David often found pleasure and relaxation working in his garden. He was especially proud of the wide variety of vegetables he always managed to grow in Canada's often unforgiving weather. He was predeceased by his loving wife of 52 years, Maria Pilar, in 2010. David is survived by his six children (David [Lynn] in Chelsea, Quebec, John [Alice] in Richmond BC, Andrew [Freda] in Raleigh, NC, Jose-Ignacio in Calgary, Denise [Keith] in Hamilton, and Daniel in Calgary), seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

Born and raised in Calgary, Ron attended Viscount Bennett High School before commencing at Mount Royal College. In 1969, Ron married Joan Coffey and, together, they moved to Windsor, ON where Ron graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Windsor. Upon graduation, they returned to Calgary where Ron articled for his Chartered Accounting designation with Deloitte Touche. Upon receiving his C.A., Ron began his career as a public accountant. Three wonderful children enriched their marriage; after an amicable parting of the ways between Joan and Ron, he met Darleen in 1985 and they were married in 1986. Ron continued public accounting until his unexpected death. Mike and his wife, Sheila, have 3 children, Kayla, Megan and Emily; Kevin has a daughter, Abigail; and Jenny (Jeremy) has a daughter Teagan. Ron is also survived by Darleen's children, Donald and Lori (Harvey); and by Ron's sister, Linda (Neil), as well as nieces and nephews. Ron was predeceased by his parents, Reg and Doris, a number of years ago. When Ron wasn't at work, he was watching his grandchildren at soccer games; and, if it wasn't soccer, Darleen and Ron could be found on the golf course. Ron was a "closet" car buff: while burning the midnight oil during tax season, he would scour Kijiji and Auto Trader for his next ride. By April 30, a gently used vehicle would be found in his garage. Ironically, it was only six months ago that Ron purchased his first new car. In celebration of Ron's life, Funeral Services will be held at Eden Brook Memorial Gardens & Funeral Home (located at the intersection of 17 Avenue SW and Lower Springbank Road) on Wednesday, August 5, 2015 at 11:00 a.m. In lieu of flowers, if so desired, donations in Ron's memory may be made to the Heart & Stroke Foundation, 100 - 119 14 Street NW, Calgary, Alberta T2N 1Z6.

Like many other trips, this one also led him to help someone.Welcomed into the world on March 1, 1980, he immediately gave blissful joy to his parents, Baljinder Singh and Sukhvir Kaur Bhullar, his grandparents, Jagir Singh and Mohinder Kaur Bhullar and Late Ram Singh and Late Gurdev Kaur Shergill.He easily eclipsed his older sister Tarjinder's prominence in the family. A few years later, he said hello to his younger brother Appy, who would become his lifelong right hand man.His aunts and uncles from the Bhullar, Shergill, Lail, Sekhon, and Sidhu family, showered him with love.His cousins Amardeep (Sukhi), Tammy (Sanjay), Parabhdeep, Sonny (Nisha), Shannon (Inder), Sam, Dilpreet (Balcharan), Jasleen, Sundeep, Sharon, Simran, Karen, Harmol, Rabina, Jagmeet, Hamreet, Anmol, Arvinder, Aman (Stacey), and Raman, gave him endless love and laughter.His friends, who if named here would leave little room for any other stories in today's paper, were synonymous with family.Growing up he played hockey on the streets and driveways of Whitehorn and dabbled in tae kwon do, where he mastered skills less and dramatic poses more. He had entrepreneurial spirit, with a lawnmower and cousins in tow. A proud northeast boy, he never forgot about his time at Chief Justice Milvain Elementary and Annie Gale Junior High. The only time you didn't prominently see him with his turban, was when he put on a helmet to play High School football at Lester B. Pearson High School.He didn't fancy himself as an academic, yet somehow he went on to get his Bachelors in Sociology, beginning it at the Mount Royal University and completing it from the University of Athabasca. Later while MLA, he obtained his Law Degree from the University of Windsor. He was the first to encourage others to pursue further education.It was a chance meeting at an evening Punjabi class 13 years ago, where he attended as a guest speaker, that Namrita Rattan entered his life. The rest, as they say, is history. In some ways their relationship defied logic. In every way it showed you that real love means having an unabiding faith in one another, matched with patience and humour. On January 7, 2012, they became husband and wife. Her parents, Dalbir Singh and Kiran Kaur Rattan, sister Sushana (Jason), and brother Harsimer, welcomed him as a son and brother long before the wedding.Manmeet welcomed another sister into his life when Appy married Amrit in 2013.The relationship that guided him most was the one he shared with God. Sikhism gave him the convictions of seva (selfless work), equality for all, and the responsibility of sharing the sorrow of others as if they are your own.Manmeet served his community and championed causes long before he entered politics and would have done so long after he left. He was and always would have been a public servant.He was the light in our lives.Meeta, it was not only #nicetomanmeetyou, it was an absolute honour.A State Memorial Service, open to the public, will be held for Manmeet at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium (1415 - 14 Avenue NW, Calgary) on Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 12:00 p.m. Visitation will be from 9:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m.In lieu of flowers we kindly request you make a donation in his memory to the Sheldon Kennedy Child Advocacy Centre atwww.sheldonkennedycac.ca.

As a small boy, Tim was a hard worker and eager to help. He enjoyed fishing and rowdy games of street hockey with his brother, and had a great curiosity for how things worked. As a young man he developed a knack for taking things apart and fixing them-everyone knew to bring him anything that was broken, knowing it'd be as good as new. At the University of Windsor, Tim earned a degree in Computer Science as well as Engineering, and was a member of Mensa. He went on to apply his skills with great success. Soon he met Patricia Smith, a lively young woman who shared his love of adventure, and they married. Over time, Tim worked as a software developer and then found his niche as a functional manager for technology companies Nortel and SMART, where he enjoyed mentoring. Finding great pride in workmanship, Tim maintained a beautiful home, spending many hours in the vegetable garden and yard. He and his wife loved their quirky dogs and were always ready to take in a stray. When Pat's health declined, he took care of her while she received a kidney transplant. Some of their favourite memories together were spent watching classic movies and gardening. It was in Alberta that Tim discovered a love of hiking. He summited challenging peaks and scaled ridges, taking in expansive views while seeking out wild and beautiful places. His adventures and stories reflected his passion and it was in the mountains where he was happiest. Tim was predeceased by his father and brothers Fred and Randy. He is survived by his wife Pat, daughter Lindsay and son-in-law Michael, their three children; and his mother, sister Gayle, brother George, nieces and nephews and grandnieces and nephews. Tim will be remembered for the help he offered family and friends, and the adventurous spirit that was such a great part of him.		t	NULL	NULL	51.05	-114.085

It is difficult to summarize a life in just a few sentences. Leo believed that there had to be one more miracle out there that he could claim and we marveled at how he fought the cancer with dignity and determination but was totally at peace with God's will. Leo was born in Leamington, Ontario to Arthur and Anna Bouckhout, their only child. Leo completed his first degree in Biology at the University of Windsor; Masters degree in Environmental Science from the University of Calgary; Executive Development from Banff School of Management. Leo started his career at Lombard North, an environmental consulting firm in Calgary. That is where he met Nadine and they married in June, 1974. Leo's environmental career continued at Foothills Pipe Lines, Husky Oil, Canadian Petroleum Association, and E2 Environmental Alliance. In 2002 he joined Matrix Solutions where he was Vice President - International Division until his passing. Since 1992 Leo completed more than fifty consulting and training assignments worldwide for industrial clients, foreign governments and international financial institutions. His work took him to more than twenty countries on five continents. They have two wonderful children, Nicole born in 1977 and David in 1980. Nicole has his love for chocolates, shopping and his attention to detail; David has his skills of good financial management and his passion for cars. There are so many things that we will miss about Leo; his laugh, his positive attitude on life reminding us that "we have to play the hand that God dealt", and his unconditional love for his family. Leo will be joining his Mom and Dad in eternity with the precious Lord Jesus. He will be remembered by his wife Nadine; daughter Nicole and her husband Colin Schieman and granddaughter Ruby Schieman; son David. He will also be remembered by family in Saskatoon - mother-in-law Pauline Bodnar, Walter Bodnar and family, Ernie and Bernice Bodnar, and Darlene Bodnar.

A first generation Canadian, Ed was born in Toronto following the emigration of his parents from the Netherlands and spent his childhood in Windsor, Ontario. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree (1971) in psychology and a Bachelor of Laws degree (1976) from the University of Windsor. After graduation, Ed made his way to Calgary along with three friends and classmates - Noel O'Brien, Q.C., Brian Devlin, Q.C. and Tim Williamson (now of Vancouver) in an infamous U-haul caravan drive - to Calgary in what he fondly described as the "Windsor Mafia" of law grads accumulating in the Calgary area at that time. Ed articled with the Calgary law firm, Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer (BD&P) under the guidance of (now Mr. Justice) John Rooke who became a close, life-long friend. Ed was admitted to the Alberta Bar in 1977 following which he continued on with BD&P practising primarily corporate securities law for the next ten years. He joined the partnership of BD&P in 1981 and then completed a two-year assignment with the firm's international office in London, England. After returning to Calgary, Ed established a commodity trading firm providing hedging programs and trading services to junior oil and gas operators. This complex world of options and trading strategy was always of keen interest to Ed's analytical mind, an interest which continued throughout his life. In 1989, Ed joined the Calgary law firm of McCaffery Goss as a securities and corporate lawyer. In 1993, he wrote a well-regarded technical book "Broker's Liability: Emergence and Avoidance", now in its twelfth printing, which for several years was required reading for the Canadian Securities Institute course for brokers and registered representatives. From 1993 through 2001 Ed was a sole practitioner in securities and corporate finance for junior energy and mining companies. He served on the boards of several public and private companies and was founder and CEO of several successful oil and gas drilling funds. Ed's fondness for travel and interest in business and finance took him to Doha, Qatar in 2001, where he joined the partnership of Gebran Majdalany, a major international law firm. His work focussed on the financing, structure and closing of many major deals between companies, their lenders, and the Qatari government. He also acted as local counsel for numerous international law firms doing business in Qatar. In mid 2007, he joined Qatari Diar, an investment arm of Qatar Investment Authority. During the time Ed resided in Calgary, he enjoyed time spent in the Windermere Valley, B.C., and was an avid alpine skier. He greatly enjoyed scuba diving and had achieved the Dive Master (Padi) designation in the mid 1980s. His diving log book records time spent underwater in numerous exotic locations. Ed had recently returned to Calgary for an extended visit with old friends when he fell suddenly ill. In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by his only sibling, Margo Van der Touw (husband, David Sinclair) of Terrace, British Columbia; two nephews, Benjamin and Dominic Salopek of Vancouver, numerous extended family members in Ontario and the Netherlands, many friends in Alberta, Ontario and overseas. He was predeceased by his father Nicolaas in 1999 and his mother Rie in 2002. A celebration of Ed's life will be held on Monday, April 28 at the Ranchmen's Club at 710 - 13 Avenue S.W. at 2:30 p.m. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that donations be made to the "Edward Vink Baby Fund", at any branch of CIBC worldwide.

His great love of life, expansive spirit and sense of humour touched everyone who knew him. Rene was born May 12, 1935 in Leeuwarden, in the Dutch province of Frysland. He spent much of the German occupation of Holland on the Harmsma farm in Joure, Holland. Rene's secondary education began with a degree in Hotel Management in Holland. Continuing his studies in Canada, he earned his M.B.A. from the University of Windsor in Ontario. Rene married Claudette Demers and had two daughters, Gabrielle and Nadine. The family later moved to Alberta where he worked as District Manager of Versafood Services. Rene's life took an unexpected turn in the mid-seventies, while looking for fossils. After coming across the little known fossilized gemstone Ammolite, Rene traded his chef's cap for a white cotton slouch hat and took to fossil-hunting full time. Rene developed and owned the Natural History Museum in Banff until 1981. Korite was purchased in 1979 with partners James Rae and Bill Jarvis. Pierre Pare and Wilson Yip joined the partnership and together they built Korite Minerals. They started Canada Fossils in 1985. Rene was instrumental in having Ammolite recognized as a gemstone, marketing it worldwide. For his accomplishments he was awarded the Alberta Centennial Medal in 2005. Rene married Shelley Vollans in Banff in 1986. They loved scuba diving. Together they traveled the world, diving in such remote spots as Tonga and Malaysia. Shelley was a strong and loving supporter of Rene throughout his long illness. Shelley retired from her career as a Speech Pathologist to spend more time with Rene in his remaining years. Rene enjoyed cooking. He was a lover of fine food and wines, and an active member of the Chaine des Rotisseurs. An avid outdoorsman and fitness fanatic, Rene loved to swim, scuba dive, sail, cross country ski, hike, jog and bicycle. He had a great love for the arts and was passionate about classical music. He was a spirited bridge player and keen collector of antique silver. Rene is survived by his loving wife, Shelley Vandervelde; his daughters, Gabrielle and her spouse Jill Wigle; and Nadine and son-in-law Scott Kraft; granddaughters, Gabrielle and Beatrice; sister Betty Porteous; their extended families, and a very large circle of friends and business associates.

After her second                   courageous and fearless battle with cancer, she went peacefully to be with her Lord on January 24, 2013.  The second daughter of John and Therese Burt, Louise grew up in a Catholic family with three brothers and one sister in East York, Toronto, ON. In Toronto Louise attended Notre Dame High School, a Catholic all-girls school, where she excelled. Besides academics, Louise joined the band, played basketball, and acted as head prefect in her senior year. It was at Notre Dame where Louise developed               her sense of service and interest in promoting Catholic education. Following high school, she obtained her B.A. from University of Toronto, followed by a B.Ed. from the University of Windsor. In 1977 Louise married her best friend, Brian, and in 1980, the pair moved to Calgary where Louise secured a position with the Calgary Catholic School District.

Like many other trips, this one also led him to help someone. Welcomed into the world on March 1, 1980, he immediately gave blissful joy to his parents, Baljinder Singh and Sukhvir Kaur Bhullar, his grandparents, Jagir Singh and Mohinder Kaur Bhullar and Late Ram Singh and Late Gurdev Kaur Shergill. He easily eclipsed his older sister Tarjinder’s prominence in the family. A few years later, he said hello to his younger brother Appy, who would become his lifelong right hand man. His aunts and uncles from the Bhullar, Shergill, Lail, Sekhon, and Sidhu family, showered him with love. His cousins Amardeep (Sukhi), Tammy (Sanjay), Parabhdeep, Sonny (Nisha), Shannon (Inder), Sam, Dilpreet (Balcharan), Jasleen, Sundeep, Sharon, Simran, Karen, Harmol, Rabina, Jagmeet, Hamreet, Anmol, Arvinder, Aman (Stacey), and Raman, gave him endless love and laughter. His friends, who if named here would leave little room for any other stories in today’s paper, were synonymous with family. Growing up he played hockey on the streets and driveways of Whitehorn and dabbled in tae kwon do, where he mastered skills less and dramatic poses more. He had entrepreneurial spirit, with a lawnmower and cousins in tow. A proud northeast boy, he never forgot about his time at Chief Justice Milvain Elementary and Annie Gale Junior High. The only time you didn’t prominently see him with his turban, was when he put on a helmet to play High School football at Lester B. Pearson High School. He didn’t fancy himself as an academic, yet somehow he went on to get his Bachelors in Sociology, beginning it at the Mount Royal University and completing it from the University of Athabasca. Later while MLA, he obtained his Law Degree from the University of Windsor. He was the first to encourage others to pursue further education. It was a chance meeting at an evening Punjabi class thirteen years ago, where he attended as a guest speaker, that Namrita Rattan entered his life. The rest, as they say, is history. In some ways their relationship defied logic. In every way it showed you that real love means having an unabiding faith in one another, matched with patience and humour. On January 7, 2012, they became husband and wife. Her parents, Dalbir Singh and Kiran Kaur Rattan, sister Sushana (Jason), and brother Harsimer, welcomed him as a son and brother long before the wedding. Manmeet welcomed another sister into his life when Appy married Amrit in 2013. The relationship that guided him most was the one he shared with God. Sikhism gave him the convictions of seva (selfless work), equality for all, and the responsibility of sharing the sorrow of others as if they are your own.  Manmeet served his community and championed causes long before he entered politics and would have done so long after he left. He was and always would have been a public servant.  He was the light in our lives.   Meeta, it was not only #nicetomanmeetyou, it was an absolute honour.  A State Memorial Service, open to the public, will be held for Manmeet at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium (1415 - 14 Avenue N.W., Calgary) on Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 12:00 p.m. Visitation will be from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. In lieu of flowers we kindly request you make a donation in his memory to the Sheldon Kennedy Child Advocacy Centre atwww.sheldonkennedycac.ca.

Jan was born in Chatham, Ontario on October 14, 1949, and is survived by her husband Gary as well as her brother Bob Abbott and his wife Barb (McLellan). Predeceased by her sister Gale and brother-in-law Wayne Lehman, mother Doris Abbott (Prosser), father Norman Abbott, stepfather Fred Gaymer, father-in-law Lloyd Rankin and mother-in-law Myrtle Rankin (Henneker). In her early teens, Jan met the love of her life, Gary Rankin. They developed an unwavering bond of love that was second to none and were blessed with three sons. In May of this year, Jan and Gary would have celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Jan was extremely proud of her boys and their spouses, Bryce and Kim (Izatt), Aric and Michelle (Ross), and Drew and Cara (Carson) as well as her chosen son Janbek Unlu, and his wife Brooke (Girard). Recently, her world revolved around her grandchildren; Mackenna, Connor, Morgan May, and Camryn. She also loved the family "fur-babies"; Cloe, Hinto, Ella, and Tallulah. Jan will be remembered by her many dear friends, who she considered to be part of her family. Jan graduated from the University of Windsor Faculty of Education in 1971 (former Teacher's College) and subsequently completed her Bachelor of Education degree on a part-time basis while parenting and teaching. She dedicated her working life to her students, retiring in 2005 from the Greater Essex County District School Board.

Jan was a generous and compassionate person who always supported the needs and pursuits of those close to her. She also supported and donated to many charitable organizations. Jan's philosophy was to think positively, act through giving, treat everyone with respect and dignity, and to love unconditionally. Her philosophy and influence on our lives have left an everlasting impression. Like the sunflowers she loved, Jan brought a ray of sunshine and happiness to everyone's day. Whether it be a quick smile, laugh or hug, she believed a little bit of kindness shared with a friend or stranger helped to make the world a better place.The Rankin family would like to thank the Windsor paramedic service, Windsor Metropolitan Hospital Emergency Department and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from the bottom of our hearts. Special thanks to Drs. Masri and Blaszak, Registered Nurses Marina and Rosa, Nurse Practitioner Rommel, and Respiratory Therapists Lara and Katie.

He was a kind and loving husband and father, brother and friend always thinking of others before himself. Win attended Calvin College and later attended and graduated from University of Windsor as a Civil Engineer which would steer him into Land Development. He worked on several projects in the East Coast and South Western Ontario. He began the company Thames Valley Engineering along with a partner. Eventually Win ran the company on his own for a number of years and retired about three years ago. Over the years Win was actively involved in his church, Grace Christian Reformed Church, Chatham Christian School, and in the broader community. He was an active member of Rotary for many years. Win was always waiting for the chance to tell a pun. His nickname "PUNMASTR" was well deserved. He loved to get out on the water and fish for hours. He enjoyed playing golf by himself and with his golfing buddies. He was the greatest chef, you could always find him in the kitchen cooking up a storm. Win was born September 1, 1941, son of Melvin and Anna Elzinga. He was married to Marg (Medenblik, Tolsma) for almost 30 wonderful years. His children and grandchildren are: Greg and Steve, Jeff; Madeline and Alexander, Duane and Carolyn; Zachery and Adriana, Aaron and Jolene; Grace, Maggie Jo and Jonathan, Michelle. Win is survived by one sister, Gerda and Henk and one brother, Mel and Maryanne. Also survived by sisters-in-law Rita and Brad Moor, Linda and Gerry Wolting, and Enica Tolsma. Win is predeceased by his parents, three brothers, two sisters, two brothers-in-law and one sister-in-law.

Journalist, world traveller, beloved wife, loving mother, local historian, skilled baker, devoted mentor, Win was above all a survivor, who managed as a toddler to survive a flu pandemic that preyed on young people and at the age of 102 shook off a case of COVID. Win's career in journalism started in her teens, as a student reporter for the Windsor Star. She then moved on to become news editor and commentator for CFCO radio, before spending the last 25 years of her journalistic career as Chatham bureau chief of the London Free Press, where she worked long hours covering the many stories generated in a bustling community. She was also a skilled photographer, whose news and human interest pictures, particularly of children at play, would often grace the front page of the Free Press. During her lengthy retirement, she was as busy as during her working years. She completed an update of her father Victor Lauriston's highly regarded history, Romantic Kent, as well as commissioned histories and biographies of noteworthy locals such as Napoleon King and the McKeough family. For many decades, she also wrote the profiles of the annual inductees into the Kent County Agricultural Hall of Fame, and was herself inducted into the Hall in 1991. She also found time to complete her university degree, becoming at the time the oldest graduate of the University of Windsor and a member of the President's Roll for academic excellence. Travel was one of the great joys of her life. She and husband Bill travelled the world, visiting every continent except Antarctica during what in retrospect must be seen as a golden age of travel. She continued travelling solo after Bill's death, and in her 80s fulfilled a lifelong dream of following the Silk Road to fabled Samarkand. Among the honours and recognition she received, Win was a recipient of both the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee and Golden Jubilee medals, for community service and local historians respectively. Win was predeceased by husband Bill, her son Peter, also a respected journalist, and all seven of her siblings. She is survived by son Paul (Janeen), daughter-in-law Shirley, and Peter and Shirley's four children; Stephen, Patricia, Matthew and Chris. She held a special place in her heart for Paige Flint, whom she mentored from a young age, and for the grandchildren of her beloved sister Dorothy; Carmen, Francisco, Gerardo and Victor Okhuysen.Special thanks to John Willat, her friend of many years, and the staff at St. Andrews Residence, whose care and affection made her many years at the residence carefree, happy and comfortable. A funeral service and celebration of Win's life will be held on Saturday, September 9 at 11:00 a.m. at McKinlay Funeral Home, 459 St. Clair Street, Chatham, reception to follow.

Predeceased by her loving husband, Nicholas Korpan and her four sisters, Marie Mastronardi, Wilhelmina Landschoot, Rita Goldoni and Anne Westelaken as well as siblings Alfons Derynck and Blanche Roels.Johanna known as Jenny to most, grew up in Jeannettes Creek, Ontario. Raised by foster parents from a young age, she recognized the value of hard work and contributed meaningfully throughout her life. In 1955 she married Nick and moved to Chatham and they pursued the family tradition of farming until 1968 when they opened Countryside Furniture. Each brought relevant skills to the business that resulted in much success and many years of international travel. In retirement, travel remained a constant and Jenny continued to span the globe after Nick was gone, either on her own or with family members in tow.Jenny was an intelligent, diligent and caring individual. Her love of knowledge led her to pursue a degree in Sociology at the University of Windsor at the age of 45. In her leisure time activities included cooking, boating, shopping, tennis, golf and card games. As the years passed, some of these activities were replaced with Probus lectures, reading, knitting, pie making, and more card games, in particular bridge. The many hours of Scrabble, Joker and Rummoli are fondly remembered by all of her grandchildren despite Grandma typically taking home all of the winnings. Jenny, your family remains forever grateful for our time together enjoying the many joys of life.Friends may call at the Turner & Porter Yorke Chapel, 2357 Bloor Street West, Toronto, on Wednesday, August 2, 2023 from 4-7 p.m. A Funeral Mass will be held at Our Lady of Sorrows Church, 2357 Bloor St. W., Toronto, on Thursday, August 3, 2023 at 1 p.m. Entombment to follow at Park Lawn Cemetery.In Joanne's memory, please consider a donation to the Canadian Cancer Society or a charity of your choice.

He endured an incredibly long, relentless, and exacting battle with cancer and stroke. He was born in Stratford, Ontario on December 28, 1951 to Cyrus and Frances Farquharson. He will be forever loved by his wife Karen of 50 years, and his children Shannon (Will) of Toronto, and Colin (Heather) of Ottawa. He was the proud 'Poppi' of Elliott, Jayne, and Eric. Predeceased by his parents, his memory will live on through his sisters Kyna (Barry) Rowbotham of Oakwood, Karen (Jim) Roth of Waterloo, and Kristen (Ed) MacNeil of Oakville, his brother-in-law Karl (Shirley) Parks of Ottawa, and sister-in-law Karla-Jean Kordyban of Napan, NB along with numerous nieces, nephews and cousins. Earning degrees from the University of Guelph, University of Toronto and University of Windsor, Kevin began a lifelong career in education with the Lambton-Kent District School Board starting in the Science Department of Blenheim District High School in 1975. In 1999 he moved to Sarnia and became Principal for a time at Lambton Kent Composite School in Dresden, and North Lambton Secondary School in Forest before ending his career in 2006 at Alexander Mackenzie Secondary School in Sarnia. Along with teaching, he was a passionate coach, and volunteered his time coaching basketball in the high school system for over 30 years. He was proud of all of his former players and continued to follow their lives, keeping in touch with many throughout the years. One of his happiest moments was winning the OFSAA Senior Boys Championship in 1982. He was a lifelong follower of all things sports, having a special passion for the Montreal Expos and the Detroit Red Wings. When the TV was on, there was always a game on. He continued to play hockey and baseball well into his retirement and was a season ticket holder for the Sting. Post-game socializing over pizza and chicken wings was just as important to him as the game. He loved his annual road trips with friends to visit different baseball parks and cycling excursions around Ontario. Kevin had a love and affection for animals and shared his home with many dogs and birds and even a duck over the years. Before he had grandchildren to spoil he had pets, and especially loved his horse and basset hounds. One of his favorite pastimes was bird watching and he was most at home while going for walks along local nature trails and beaches communing with wildlife. Kevin had a sharp mind, a quick wit and a genuine knack for showing interest in people's lives. He was always up for a story or a laugh, and many will remember his amazing aptitude for trivia. In recent years he discovered his artistic side surprising family and friends with his watercolour caricatures and cartoons. He had an incredible circle of lifelong friends with whom he celebrated the good times, and who supported him through the worst. He also had a special affinity for all of the caregivers who kept his last days comfortable. A celebration of Kevin's life will be announced at a later date.

Dale passed in the early morning hours of March 6, 2021, with family by his side, at the Chatham-Kent Health Alliance, Chatham Campus. Beloved husband of 51 years to Sharren Eveland (nee Steele). Dear father of Bruce Eveland (Lenni Carreiro), and Michael Eveland (Laura). Cherished papa of Caitlyn Eveland, and Randall Alexander Eveland. He will be fondly remembered by his nieces and nephews. Dale had many close friends, and was a proud member of the "Circle of Wisdom." Dale was born earlier than expected at the weight of 2 lbs. He was born a fighter.  He was raised in Erieau by his Guardians Bruce and Virginia LaMarsh.  He attended the Erieau school and with Bruce as Leader of the Boy Scouts, Dale learned many skills.  Bruce was Dale's pillar and set a very strong knowledge and skill base for Dale. Dale continued his education at Blenheim District High School, going on to Western University of London, with his friends Doug Marlatt and Don Slavic. During the summers he worked at "The Colonel's" in Rondeau Park, as well as, Southwestern Regional Centre.  In September, 1969, he married and he attended Teacher's College in Windsor.  Dale's first placement was in Leamington where he resided for three months with sister Nora and family, then moving to Erieau for three months, and on to The Monastery Apartments, in Blenheim.  Along the way with car pools and experiences, he met many wonderful lifetime friends.  Dale was hired to the Kent County School Board immediately following his graduation.  His first assignment was in Special Education at Queen Mary Public School teaching Science and Math.  In five years time, he was placed at Mc Keough Public School as Vice Principal.  Under the  mentorship of Don Braddon, Chuck Rowland and Jim McVicar, Dale acquired many vital skills to become a very fine administrator.  His first position as Principal was the Ministry School at Southwestern Regional Centre.  His task there was to close the school and make preparations for those students to be assigned to local schools.  Further assignments were as Principal for Mc Keough P. S., Victoria Park P. S. Lord Tweedsmere, H.A Tanser and finally retiring from the W. J. Barid P. S..  Dale and his friend Wayne O' Sullivan were both avid supporters and Presidents of the Men's Federation of Teachers, attending many of their conferences in Toronto.  During the course of his positions; he and Uly Bondy particularly, with several others from both the Kent County and Catholic School Boards orchestrated the Special Education Conference in Windsor.  Dale worked tirelessly on the Identification and Placement & Review Committees of Special Education students.  Dale helped countless students find the what, where and how to meet the needs to best succeed in this ever changing world we now live in.  Summer and night courses kept him quite busy keeping up with requirements of his profession.  Robert Bolus hired Dale to teach the class of Special Education Teachers through the University of Windsor, so those teachers could get their qualifications to teach in that field.  The Amalgamation of the Kent County School Board with the Lambton School Board was quite a challenge, which in his devotion to education again contributed greatly to that process to which we now call The Lambton Kent District School Board. Dale left many close friends behind including the afore-mentioned as well as Jack Collins, Ruth Crispell, Diane Steele Myers, Craig Koehlor, Brad Snoblen, Ed O'Brien, and Ken King as well as so many more that can't be included. Dale was a devoted family man.  Family was the most important aspect of his life.  The early loss of his brother Randy made Dale appreciate every day he had.  Dale was so proud of both of his sons Bruce and Michael and their accomplishments.  Their marriages to Lenni and Laura respectively added more joy and two beautiful grandchildren Caitlyn and Alex. Visitation will be held at the Funeral Home, 141 Park Street, Blenheim, on Wednesday, March 10, 2021 from 2-4 p.m. and 7-9 p.m.; where the Funeral Service will be held on Thursday afternoon at 1 p.m. A live-stream will be available on the funeral home website.

Survived by his wife, Mary Louise (Murphy) Kuni and their children, David (Annie) Kuni, and Joëlle Kuni (Greg Long). Proud Grandpa to Matthew and Chloë Kuni, and Caleb Long. Also surviving are his brothers, Wendell Kuni (Brenda), and Anthony Kuni (Alma), and several nieces and nephews. Predeceased by his parents Frank and Maria (Baumann) Kuni, and his brothers, Alex, Frank, and Steve Kuni. Joe was born on Easter Sunday, April 21, 1946, in Kleinsteinbach, Germany.  Joe and his family immigrated to Canada in August 1952, and moved to Raleigh Township. Joe and Tony attended St. Patrick's School in Merlin, where they both quickly learned the English language and about life in Canada. A good education was important to Joe and he excelled at his schooling while continuing his work chores at home. After moving to Chatham, Joe attended John McGregor Secondary School, then Chatham Collegiate Institute. After graduating, he attended Windsor Teachers College, and was hired by the then Chatham Catholic Separate School Board. He taught at two schools in Chatham-Kent, before becoming a Principal at several schools including St. Ambrose, Christ the King (Wallaceburg), John Uyen, St. Vincent, St. Mary's (Blenheim), and St. Agnes. While continuing his career in education, he obtained his Bachelor of Arts, University of Windsor and his Master of Education, University of Toronto.  He also worked as Assistant to the Director for four years in this time, before retiring in 1998. His love of education and the English language continued over his career, always encouraging children to learn.  Although he would reprimand a student for misbehaving, the children always knew that the following day their slate would be clean.  Family, friends, and hopefully, many of his students will remember his smile and joy for life. At Joe's wishes, cremation has taken place, with a private family burial service at a later date.  A Celebration of Life will be held Saturday, February 9, 2019, 2-4 p.m., at Aristo's, 307 Grand Avenue West, Chatham.

John died Wednesday, December 12, 2018 at St. Peter's Hospital in Hamilton.   John leaves wife Linda Cox, daughters Lynette Scott (Dave), Leanne Cummings (Dan) and Lisa King (Jay Henry), stepsons Matt Parsons (Leslie), Luke Parsons (Sarah) and Dan Cox (Dara), grandchilden Jackie, Katie, J.R., Chayton, Tehya, Riley, Quinn and Ella, sisters Beth Spence (Todd) and Wilma Caron (Virgil Wilson) and brother Owen Roberts (Angi). He also leaves many nieces and nephews who knew and loved Uncle John. As well, he leaves his beloved dogs Ben, Robbie and Cooper.    John was born in Chatham on May 31, 1944, the eldest son of the late Art Roberts and Evelyn Roberts (nee Cadotte). He attended a one-room schoolhouse near Mitchell's Bay for his primary education, and he went on to graduate from Wallaceburg District High School, the University of Windsor and what was then the University of Western Ontario.   In the workforce, writing and learning remained a constant in John's life. Early in his career, he worked at Random House, one of Canada's largest book publishers, editing manuscripts and working with some of the country's most prolific writers. He would go on to publish more than 40 books, including co-authoring a best-selling book on the Toronto Maple Leafs.   Ultimately, John resumed his graduate studies part-time and earned a Ph.D. He enjoyed a long and illustrious career as a tenured professor of language studies at Mohawk College in Hamilton. After retirement, he entered a new career as a supply teacher for Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board.    In education, his passion was for improving education for Indigenous students. This was driven in part by his own Indigenous heritage as an Anishnabe Métis. He developed curriculum that taught children from an Indigenous perspective, and advocated for better funding for on-reserve schools. Many of his text books helped shape how high school students understood Canada's Indigenous peoples.   As an Indigenous leader, John founded the Canadian Métis Council and served as the director of education for the Ontario Coalition of Indigenous Peoples. He was an outspoken advocate for Indigenous rights and through the media drew attention to the plight of urban aboriginal and Métis populations.   He used his expertise in Canadian aboriginal culture to improve training for police services, publishing textbooks for basic recruits and officers that would provide a better understanding around Indigenous culture. John also served on the Hamilton Chief of Police's Committee for Minority Relations and was a former auxilary member of the Niagara Regional police.   Wanting to know more about his own Métis heritage, John researched and wrote the thorough Roberts/Cadotte family history stretching back into the 1600s. He also wrote articles for the Ontario Genealogical Society, showing people how to research their own Métis ancestry.   John was a huge animal lover and made many friends walking his dogs in his Queen St. E. neighbourhood.    A mass for John will be held Friday, December 21 at St. Joseph's Parish Church, 260 Herkimer St., Hamilton. Visitation will take place from 10 a.m.-11 a.m., followed by mass at 11 a.m. and lunch and celebration of life from noon - 2 p.m. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Native Women's Centre,www.nativewomenscentre.comCondolences, memories and photos may be left atwww.circleoflifecbc.com	In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Native Women's Centre,www.nativewomenscentre.comCondolences, memories and photos may be left atwww.circleoflifecbc.com	t	NULL	NULL	42.401	-82.1857

Born February 9, 1924 to James Hutton Gemmel and Hilda Godfrey Towersey Gemmel in London England. Upon the declaration of World War II, Margaret was a graduate of Clarke's Business College. In an effort to support the troops, Margaret enrolled in nursing school in 1942. She nursed injured soldiers until D-Day in 1945. Margaret immigrated to Canada in 1947. She was employed as a nursing assistant at Chatham Public Hospital. She co-managed Glen Gordon Manor on the shores of Lake Erie. She was a member of the original team of professionals that opened the Southwestern Regional Centre where she became a residential counselor. Margaret went on to work as a dental assistant at the centre, then Vocational Instructor, and finally Director of Vocational Services while studying for a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology at University of Windsor. By the late 70's, Margaret and her team were instrumental in facilitating job placement and community housing for almost 1000 residents. Margaret was a founding member of Chatham-Kent Crisis Line, The Southwestern Regional Centre Credit Union, the CK Association of Community Living and an executive member of the Canadian Association of Rehabilitation Personnel. Margaret was an active member of the United Church, leading the Canadian Girls In Training (CGIT) for many years. She started the first Home and School group at Cedar Springs Elementary School. Throughout all these accomplishments, her greatest achievement was her children and grandchildren. Her home was a welcoming place where a pot of tea and a listening ear was always present. It was important to her to demonstrate respect and responsibility not only to her children, but to her nieces and nephews from a very young age. Margaret married the love of her life, Armand Curtis (1993), in 1979. Margaret raised 6 children. She was predeceased by her step daughter, Deanne (James McPhail), son Glen Barton (Donna) and daughter Betsy (Jim Steele). She is survived by 3 daughters, Barbara (Don) Phair, Vi Burlein (Mike Papps) and Julie (Rick Chambers). Margaret was very proud of her 13 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren as well as 3 great-great-grandchildren. Margaret also leaves behind numerous nieces, nephews, her long time companion Paul Albert, and numerous dear friends both in Ontario and Florida, whose lives were touched by her loving kindness.

Predeceased by her parents Donald and Helen Case (nee Corbett), her brothers Charles and Patrick Case and survived by a brother, John C. Case of Morpeth, and sisters Clairinne Audrey (Mrs. J. Williams) of High River Alta and Ila Dulcie (Mrs. Wayne Campbell) of Petrolia, ON. All five children of her marriage also surviving - John Scott Waller Harrison (and wife Wendy) of Ottawa, ON, Joanne Leslie (Mrs. Curtis Buell) of Winnipeg MAN, Robert Stephen Harrison of Fort St. James BC, Pamela Eileen Lord (Mrs. Lloyd Lord) of Winnipeg MAN, and Evelyn Kim Harrison of Lethbridge ALTA and, of course an accumulation of 8 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. Married at 18 to her soldier husband, Clairanne evolved into an ideal military wife, bore five healthy children and followed, without complaint, her husband throughout his military career. When they retired back to Chatham her address book indicated 21 addresses since her marriage. She has made homes in Ontario (multiple), the Yukon, Alberta, Nova Scotia, London UK, and Lahr Germany. A Stay-at-home Mom until the last child was in school she trained and became a computer programmer, a profession she worked at in London UK, Ottawa, Calgary and Halifax thereby keeping her husband in tailor-made cigarettes. An accomplished driver she enjoyed club-level car rallying and particularly competing on equal terms with male drivers. As a seamstress she made several wedding dresses for brides while in the Yukon, and became a master knitter, a skill she taught as well as tatting and, in retirement was a regular contributor of bonnets/helmets for newborns here in Chatham. Upon retirement she opted to gain the education she had missed by early marriage, earning a Bachelor's Degree (English) at University of Windsor and following up with a Masters Degree in Religious Studies at the University of Western Ontario (after her 65th birthday). Her travels included most of the capitols of Europe (including East Berlin, Budapest, both solo), the Greek Islands, the Canary Islands, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, a knitters tour in the Hebredies including the isle of Skye and a solo drive (in her very own MGB) from John o' Groats to Land's End. My lady-wife lived a full life and left it I am sure with few regrets having finally succumbed to Alzheimers (the kindest disease for the elderly) with no memory of any unpleasantness that her long life may have included. While a confirmed Anglican she expressly demanded no funeral, no service, no marker, and her ashes to be distributed along some quiet country road such as those she had so enjoyed driving. Her wish is that her family and friends remember her as she was in health. Sobeit!McKINLAY FUNERAL HOME459 St. Clair Street, Chatham519-351-2040		t	NULL	NULL	42.401	-82.1857

Cherished grandmother of Mariel and Claire Lacina, Jake and Kyle Lewis, and Jennifer Dillon. Dear sister of Ljuba Mollmann of Denmark. Predeceased by her husband, Frank Capewell (2011) and her sister,, Vera Glass of Brazil (2012). Nadia was born Nadezda Palanova in Hradec Králové, Czechoslovakia, near Prague. Her family moved to Recife, Brazil in September 1939. After finishing high school, Nadia obtained a filing job at the American military base in Recife. She moved to Rio De Janeiro in 1949 and held several jobs in military departments within the Joint Brazil-United States Military Commission. Nadia met her husband, Frank, a British Army veteran working in Rio, at a New Year's Eve party. Their time in Rio gave them a love of the ocean and outdoors. They married and immigrated to Canada in 1953, landing in Montreal, followed by moves to Toronto, Guelph, Brantford and Chatham where they raised their family. Nadia taught English to immigrants from Czechoslovakia who arrived in the Chatham area in the late 1960s and became interested in teaching. She completed a BA in French and Spanish at the University of Windsor as well as a teaching certificate, teaching in Kent County for several years. Nadia and Frank enjoyed skiing and travel during which Nadia could practice the five languages she spoke fluently. They retired to London in 1983 where Nadia was a volunteer for over 20 years at Museum London in the Art Rental and Sales Gallery. Nadia had a long life full of adventure and our family was very lucky to hear all her stories from many places around the world.

McKINLAY FUNERAL HOME    459 St. Clair Street,    Chatham    519 351 2040    Mr. Shephard  WE SHARE OUR DAD WITH THE COMMUNITY AND THE WORLD    Born  January 9, 1944  Buenos Aires, Argentina    At Rest  September 28, 2017 Chatham, Ontario, Canada  Robin was a disciplined and devout Christian - a true follower of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Jesus was Robin's friend and very real source of comfort...the centre and foundation of his life. Two days before he passed he sat with his youngest son Derek, delivering one of his sermons he had written with passion and tears. He loved Jesus and made it his mission to share that love and relationship with others because he felt and we echo "It's a life worth living." Robin's adventurous spirit led him to emigrate from England to Canada in the late 60's taking the oath of citizenship in 1972. Hungry for knowledge he graduated from the University of Guelph in 1971. Throughout the mid-70's - early 80's, while raising a young family, he earned his teaching certificate from Western University, then going on to earning his Masters of Education from the University of Windsor. Robin was an extraordinary teacher and tutor, mentor and friend to many. His legacy will live on in the lives of his pupils, colleagues and friends. Robin was a man who lived life to the fullest and shared so much warmth, good humour and wisdom. He was a patient listener and always put the needs of others ahead of his own always leaving a lasting impression on those who came to him. No matter how great the task or minor the issue Robin always found the time to listen and counsel others whilst offering warm friendly personality to those who he spoke with. You would walk away feeling more confident tackling that problem. Robin's words "You can do it, believe you can, you're halfway there!" In his younger years Robin was an extraordinary swimmer - butterfly stroke he had mastered. He loved Canada, great outdoors, camping, walking on many the nature trail - and falling a time or two! Robin was a charismatic and passionate story-teller. He could talk to anyone about anything on almost any subject. He loved to learn and had a fascinating mind. His endless quest for "why was this?" "What was that?" had him constantly scratching his head and looking things up so he could sleep at night. If he didn't know the answer he would often say "leave that with me" and always get back to the person who asked the question. Such was his devotion to others. He built a telescope with a friend to examine the solar system and had such a good handle on every element of the periodic table - he could help the most non-sciencey pupil enjoy his class and pass the course! He genuinely made you feel like you were the most important person on earth when he was talking to you. His knowledge, skills and attributes demanded that he have an audience. Whether that was in the form of classroom, church congregation, and face-to-face meetings - Robin thirsted for conversation. He could read in front of a crowd in a way that would make anyone sit up and listen. Words fall short and cannot properly express how deeply Robin will be missed by his family and his many friends and students whose lives he has enriched. Much loved by students, past & present, from McGregor, Chatham-Kent Secondary Schools, and most recently St. Clair College nursing students. Robin played an active lead role in starting Debating Clubs and Rugby in Chatham-Kent. He loved a good game of chess with anyone who would play him. He volunteered to coach many a sport with women's soccer being a favourite repeat and even once the cheerleading squad. He gave selflessly of his time volunteering for many years at the Chatham Jail through the Restorative justice program and most recently Habitat for Humanity and the Saturday Breakfast Program at First Presbyterian Church.   Mr. Shepherd will be missed.

Cherished and deeply loved by his devoted wife, Ann Boyd, his sisters Paula, Andra and Dana; loved and missed by his mother-in-law Elizabeth Boyd, brothers-in-law Randy Boyd, Lindsay Boyd (Cindy) and Bryan Davies and numerous cherished members of the Takacs, Boyd, and Ivan clans.  Loved and predeceased by his parents Joe and Paula (Ivan) Takacs, and his sister-in-law Debbie. David was born in Windsor, Ontario, where he spent most of his formative years. Schooling included Ridley College and the University of Windsor, where he met the love of his life, Ann Boyd. Together they became elementary school teachers and settled in the Waterford, Ontario area, where they lived together with their numerous feline companions until his death. David's teaching career was cruelly ended prematurely when he was diagnosed with scleroderma in 1995. Despite being unable to work after that time, David continued to engage and delight family and friends with his knowledge of astronomy, love of music and his amazing sense of humour. His gentleness, optimism and love of life, despite the medical adversity he encountered, inspired everyone. David's family is very grateful to the many caring medical and support staff who assisted with his medical and home needs over the past twenty years - too numerous to identify individually here.

Dana died peacefully surrounded by her family and friends following her eight-and-a-half year battle with cancer. She leaves behind her husband and rock, Paul, and her angel, her reason to fight as long and hard as she did, Isabella Kai. Dana is also survived by her mother Margaret Santavy; brothers Greg Santavy and his fiancée Leah Lee and Mark Santavy and his wife Mary Lynn; nephews Nathan, Brayden, and Chase; in-laws Mariano and Santina Brezzi; sister-in-law Patricia and her husband John Edmonson; and nieces Sara and Courtney. Dana is predeceased by her father Frank Santavy and nephew Tyson Santavy. While we grieve for this beautiful life taken too soon, our hearts overflow with gratitude that we were able to bear witness to the inspiring life she led. It has been a humble privilege and great blessing to share in this journey with her. Born in Chatham, Ontario, Dana was raised a Blenheim girl, complete with summers spent by the lake and culminating in her loss of the coveted Blossom Queen title. She went on to attend the University of Windsor, where she earned her Bachelor's degree in Communications and late-night border-crossing booze runs. She began her career at RM in 1995 and quickly became RM's head cheerleader and beloved snowflake of Rob Myers. Her career brought her around the world, including a quick stint as a California girl living in Santa Monica, and ultimately making her way home to meet the love of her life, Paul Brezzi. The two married in 2006 and gave birth to beautiful Isabella Kai in 2007. Dana's joyful spirit lit up every place she went and dazzled every person she met. Hundreds of people called her friend and thousands of people have been inspired by her story of hope in the midst of great challenge. In the short years she had, she taught us all to love without abandon, to live without fear, to celebrate today, to hope for the future, and to find joy in the everyday miracles of life. Dana was a vivacious soul, always planning a new adventure and ready to make new memories. She had an open heart and an open home, and she made everything beautiful. She was an incredible wife, mother, daughter, daughter-in-law, sister, aunt, and friend. She was the memory keeper for countless groups of friends, family, and soul sisters. She made friends everywhere she went, whether from the far corners of the globe or just across her hometown-and once you were a friend, you were a friend for life. She was the glue who held us all together over the years. To be loved by her was an enormous joy, and our lives are so much richer for having known her. Dana did not have the time here with us that we so hoped she would, but she did have just enough time to forever change the lives she touched. Visitation services will be held on Thursday, April 7, from 12:00-3:00 pm and 5:00-8:00 pm at The Armoury in Chatham at 44 William St. N. A funeral service will be held on Friday, April 8, at 2:00 pm at the same location.

With her usual flair, she embraced the party at her daughter's home with laughter, lively conversation, grace, astuteness, a glass of wine in her hand and a cat on her lap.Maggie slipped away on the evening of September 4 while sitting and chatting about the beautiful dreams she had been having that day.Passionate and multifaceted, Maggie inspired those who knew her with her adventuresome and inquiring spirit. She was swimming in the lake at 98 years of age, continued her daily walks, even in - 20 degrees, while living at Canterbury Manor in Edmonton, and had just purchased her Edmonton Symphony tickets for the coming season.Born and raised in Regina, Saskatchewan, she acquired her ARCT (Associate of The Royal Conservatory) and studied to become a concert pianist before being convinced by her mother, a teacher, and her father, a principal, that a teaching career would be more lucrative.Maggie began her varied career during the 1930s in a one-room schoolhouse in Lumsden, Saskatchewan, an experience lovingly recounted many times over the years. A few years later, she began teaching in Regina and inspired her Grade 2 class to win the Kiwanis choral provincial shield.After a move to Ontario, she became the manager of the record library for Heintzman's in Windsor.It was in Ontario that she met her future husband, Kenneth Walter Dandie, a staunch Scotsman. They lived in Windsor, Regina and Edmonton and shared a long and full life together that embraced a loving family, wonderful friendships, travel, interesting careers and a commitment to helping others.A tireless volunteer, Maggie was involved with many organizations, including the May Court, Pilot, and IODE clubs of Windsor, and served as president of both the Windsor Kinettes and the Women's Ad and Sales Club. Always fashionable, she often modeled for fundraising events.At the age of 40, while working as a social worker for Children's Aid Society in Windsor, she completed her psychology degree at the University of Windsor.Her concern for the plight of polar bears took her to Churchill, Manitoba, during the 1970s, long before tours became available. She travelled alone by train, stayed in a room above the local bar, and hired a taxi to travel to the outskirts of town to discreetly observe the majestic animals she loved. For the remainder of her years, she was a financial supporter of, and an outspoken advocate for the species.An ardent supporter of a multitude of causes, especially those involving the positive treatment of animals and the environment, she was also a devoted mother, an inspiration to her friends, a voracious reader, a CBC fan, a lover of wearing bright red lipstick, a fabulous hostess, an art collector, and a foreign film aficionado. She loved crossword puzzles and newspapers, especially when there was a cat curled up by her side.Maggie was blessed with a full and active life of 100 years and, in turn, those who knew her, were blessed with knowing her beautiful searching spirit. As she lived, may those who loved her, emulate her vibrant and fully-embraced life.Predeceased by: her parents Dorothy and Norman Detwiler, her siblings Gwendolyn, Eleanor, Arthur and their spouses; her husband of 57 years, Kenneth; her first husband of 5 years, Clarence Coghlin; and by her grandson Matthan Quince.

He was always ready for a spirited philosophical discussion on any topic. Murray had a wonderful sense of humor; he liked nothing better than to hear or tell a good story followed by his hearty and infectious laugh.

Beloved wife of John for 60 wonderful years. Loving Mom of Tom (Jane) Robinson of Churchill ON, Paul (Arlette) Robinson of Houston, Texas, Lisa LaPorte of Seaforth ON and Lorelei (Brent) Lingard of Bayfield ON. Devoted grandma of Richard, James and Sarah Robinson, Justin (Amanda) and Jonathan Riley, and Connor and Graeme Lingard. Proud great-grandma of Dawson and Haylee Riley. Margaret was born in Staffa ON to Isabel and Elmer Colquhoun.  The 8th of 12 children, Margaret is survived by her sisters, Audrey Hepburn of Stratford ON and Isabel Theedom of Calgary AB, and her brother Tom Colquhoun of Clinton ON. Margaret's energy and commitment were legendary in both her family and her community. She will be best remembered, though, for her dedication to education. As a student in 1947, she was the only one of her grade 13 class in Clinton to go to university; in 1951, her hard work and love of learning won her the gold medal for top marks in her graduating class at the University of Western Ontario. Years later, in her 50s, she completed a Masters of English jointly at the University of Windsor ON and the University of Warwick UK.  She encouraged her children to follow their dreams and provided the education to make those dreams a reality. Her profound belief in the value of education extended to her grandchildren, who are benefiting now from the plans she set up to support their post secondary education. Margaret's educational legacy extends well beyond her family. She influenced hundreds of students in her role as a dedicated teacher for over 30 years, predominantly at Central Huron Secondary School (CHSS) in Clinton ON. Best remembered as an English teacher who inspired her students' very best, she also served as Department Head, taught Physical Education, coached girls' sports teams, and supervised the school yearbook. Margaret was a teacher who attracted both love and respect, as her teaching style was shaped by her values of hard work, perseverance, excellence, fairness and courage. She would support anyone willing to work hard, regardless of background or innate ability; many students recall gratefully her ability to spot a young person's potential and help guide them onto a path to success.  She touched so many lives; we honor her memory and we are grateful for her time with us. Visitation is at FALCONER FUNERAL HOME, Clinton ON on Sunday, September 29, 2013 from 2-4 pm and 7-9pm. The funeral service will be held at 11 am on Monday, September 30 at St. Andrews United Church, Bayfield ON, after which interment of ashes will take place at Bayfield Cemetery.

Poet Rabindranath TagoreWriting comes naturally to me but putting words together that describe my husband and his life is much more difficult.I will try to give those who didn't know him a snapshot with words and for those who did know him well you already know that the world lost someone very special on March 28, 2023.Bernard Joseph Mulhern was born in Chatham, Ont., on December 2, 1948. His mother was from Pain Court, a francophone farming community near Chatham, and his father was from a small Irish community, on the ninth concession, also near Chatham.His father, Wilfred, was a decorated veteran of the Second World War who returned home to operate family hardware stores with his brothers while his mother, Ida, was a nurse who dedicated her life to the health care of others.Bernie grew up appreciating both his Irish and French heritage. He was also a gifted young athlete, playing hockey and baseball. He won awards on the ice and on the baseball field, and he helped his baseball team win a provincial championship.Youth would give way to adulthood and Bernie went to teacher's college after graduating from Grade 13. He taught middle school for a while but decided to get a degree in communications from the University of Windsor.That would lead to a job as a cameraman for the Atlantic Television Network in New Brunswick and then he would join CBC, also as a cameraman. Bernie switched to CBC radio, producing pieces for the morning and afternoon shows.But the teaching bug never really left him. He joined a fledgling journalism program at the New Brunswick Community College in Woodstock where he would spend 21 years teaching radio and television production, and Canadian studies. Bernie's former students would know how much he played the "devil's advocate" in class discussions.When NBCC-Woodstock formed a partnership with St. Thomas University, Bernie taught television production to first-year students.Bernie had some amazing travel adventures from hitchhiking around Europe, to experiencing the Okavango Delta in Botswana in a mokoro to visiting the Western Wall and Temple Mount in Jerusalem.Despite many adventures abroad, his favourite place was our home at the lake. Perfect days involved hiking, swimming, cooking and enjoying the company of good friends.His love of journalism and politics never left him in retirement and I suspect he will be ranting about Donald Trump and his cronies in the afterlife. Always curious, he was a ferocious reader who loved good books and reading and writing poetry.Bernie was predeceased by his parents Wilfred Mulhern and Ida (Poissant) Mulhern of Chatham, Ont.He is survived by his wife Annie (Anne) Mooers of Dumfries; three sisters: Mary Ellen Varney of Barrie, Ont., Pat Moore of Paris, Ont.; Elaine Mulhern (David Stasila) of Aurora, Ont.; and a brother: Paul Mulhern of Chatham, Ont., who their father affectionately called the "caboose." He is also survived by his nieces: Carolynne Varney (Anton Kacicnik) of Toronto, Ont., and Andrea Galloway (Jamie) of Orillia, Ont.; and nephew Chris Varney (Peggy) of Guelph, Ont., and four great-nephews Alex and Jack Varney, and Luke and Sam Galloway.He will be fondly remembered by his mother-in-law Frances Mooers of Nackawic. Bernie would drive Mom to appointments and take her to visit  Dad at York Care Centre. He often referred to it as Driving Miss Frances.Bernie was able to stay at home for as long as possible thanks to the excellent care provided by Extra-Mural nurses. When his situation changed, the dedicated medical team and support staff of the palliative care unit at the Dr. Everett Chalmers Hospital took over and worked to ensure he got the best care possible.Special thanks to Bernie's long-time friends: Ann Deveau, Doug Milander and Dave Tweedie, who have helped make a difficult journey bearable. Bernie will also miss chatting with neighbours and friends Aaron and Margo DeLong.I want to thank those who prayed for him from Nackawic, N.B., to Yarmouth, N.S., to Barrie, Ont., and points between. He also had friends of the Buddhist faith who chanted for him. Thank you!By request, there won't be a funeral.Donations can be made in Bernie's memory to Hospice Fredericton, the Barony Cemetery or The Twelve Neighbours Community.Arrangements by Flewelling Funeral Home, Nackawic, NB.             www.flewellingswan.com	Thank you!By request, there won't be a funeral.Donations can be made in Bernie's memory to Hospice Fredericton, the Barony Cemetery or The Twelve Neighbours Community.Arrangements by Flewelling Funeral Home, Nackawic, NB	t	NULL	NULL	45.95	-66.6667

He did further studies at the Ecole biblique et archÃƒÂ©ologique franÃƒÂ§aise and Hebrew Union College in Jerusalem. He taught biblical studies at Marygrove College in Detroit, Michigan, Holy Redeemer College in Windsor, Ontario, and at the University of Windsor from where he retired as a full professor in 1984. He was awarded the rank of professor emeritus in 1986. Through his teaching career, Edward authored several books and articles on a variety of biblical subjects. He annotated four biblical books for the Oxford Study Edition of the New English Bible. After retiring from teaching, he produced and published English translations of important books and articles by French biblical scholars. Edward had a strong commitment to human rights and social justice. For many years he was a member of and chaired Amnesty International Group 22 in Windsor. From 1942 until 1974 he was a member of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer carrying out a priestly ministry for 28 years. After leaving the Redemptorists, he shared his life with his spouse and partner, Pamela for 34 years. Together they travelled extensively in the Middle East in connection with their research and teaching. And together they worked for equity and human rights for women. Edward was also always physically active. In his youth, he was a sprinter, in midlife a hiker, runner/jogger and cross-country skier. To mark his retirement at 65, he trained for and completed the Detroit Free Press marathon and, in more recent years, he walked and exercised extensively. Most importantly, although physically separated from his family in New Brunswick, Edward remained deeply and warmly connected to them.

John is survived by his wife Barbara (nee Tait) of Cobourg, ON and two daughters: Angela of Toronto and Sarah of Nanaimo, BC. Predeceased by his mother Helen (2010) and his father John (June 23 2019), John is survived by his sister Luanne and nephews Carl and Josh Fazekas, all of Windsor. His sister Robin (Colin Williams) of Guelph was a faithful visitor until the end, providing great emotional support for our family and taking care of Grandad. John also leaves brother-in-law Robert Tait (Shel) of Alliston and Golden, their children Kathryn (partner JP Morgan) of Toronto, Melinda (partner Jon Jenkins) of Golden, BC and Stephen (partner Matt Matheson) of Calgary; sister-in-law Mary Bates (Norman) of Strathmore, Alberta; nephews Tim (Jen) and Rob Bates of Calgary and Dan Bates (partner Andrew) of Melbourne, Australia and Robin's children Rob Voisin (Erica) of Fergus and Katelyn Voisin of Waterloo. He also leaves Nevada Jenkins, Cormac and Gwyneth Bates; Luke Tait and Bailey, Madison and Stanley Voisin: most of whom he never got the chance to meet. John also had numerous cousins in London, Windsor, Detroit and Halifax. Raised in Windsor, John attended Forster Secondary School and the University of Windsor where he earned a BHK and Bachelor of Education. He was on the Dean's list in Teacher's College. John moved to Elliot Lake, ON in 1977 where he taught gym, math, art and drama at Roman Ave., Westhill and Esten Public schools. While teaching for the North Shore Board of Education, John pursued his Masters in Education and Principal's certificate through long distance education and OISE. He then accepted principals' positions at Iron Bridge Public School, and Esten Park for the Algoma District school board. His favourite school times were actually after school when he enjoyed coaching duties in volleyball, basketball, gymnastics, track and field and for his daughter Sarah's baseball team. John also enjoyed his time playing Minor League softball as a pitcher for the Legion Band and Farkouh Motors; trying to inject blues artists into the line up for the Elliot Lake Entertainment series, and acting in productions of the Ptarmigan Players. Upon retirement, John and Barb moved to Cobourg, ON where they supported Barb's parents through their final challenges but where John could also listen to live blues music, swim at the Y, and participate in community service of the Parks and Recreation Board as well as explore a whole new area of the province. A life long fan of the Detroit Tigers, Detroit Lions and the Montreal Canadians, John answered all Barb's sports clues for her crossword puzzles. A knowledgeable and avid music collector, John introduced his favourite artists to his sisters, his Windsor friends, his students, and was a ready resource for his fellow teachers when they needed a special song. A giving husband, generous and fun loving father, John brightened our lives every day with his pretzel logic, zany sense of humour and great laugh. Our favourite family times were our holidays to Florida, and Tadoussac in his sabbatical year; our trip west in 1995; summer afternoons at the local and Blind River beaches; camping trips throughout Ontario(usually in the rain) and the "officially sick and tired of winter" barbecues. The girls always appreciated their summer weeks in Windsor where John knew enough to let them have that time alone with their grandparents and cousins. As per John's request, there will be no formal service. In lieu of flowers, John would like to be remembered by donations to charities of your choice, especially those catering to the educational and physical needs of children, such as the YMCA and Song in Cobourg or to the Alzheimer Society.

I was living it."John Loewen left this world on August 3, 2023, peacefully, courageously, and surrounded by love, after a devastating and intense bout of cancer.Born in St. Boniface, Manitoba, John was the first of three sons to Jim and Myrna Loewen. John grew up in a loving home. Childhood was full of shenanigans with brother Michael (11 months his junior) and often at the expense of his little brother Brian (three years younger). John completed his high school years at Lorne Park Secondary School in Mississauga and found his calling at the University of Windsor, where he obtained his degree in Social Work and also where he met some of his closest friends.  John went on to build a beautiful career, with positions at the Queen Street Mental Health Centre, and Madison Community Services, helping countless clients and building close bonds with co-workers, Board members, and clients alike.John loved his life. He was fiercely loyal to all those he cared about. He loved being a Loewen and part of the broader Loewen clan and smaller Lewarne family. He was devoted to Sheila, his partner of 14 years. They shared a commitment to veganism and animal welfare. Together they forged a new life for themselves when John retired in 2017, leaving Toronto for a large rural property near Seeley's Bay. There they created a beautiful tranquil space, surrounded by and in harmony with nature. John embraced his new community and his new calling as steward of the land and small-scale farmer, as anyone who follows him on social media would know. John and Sheila had an impressive vegetable garden, and an apple orchard. John was very proud of their reforestation of a large section of their property, planting 4000 trees. They had chickens. John also took up beekeeping. Most recently John added a greenhouse. John was a frequent visitor to Home Hardware in Lyndhurst as he took on his various projects and loved getting to know local farmers and others in the community. John, without a doubt, had found his happy place.John was pre-deceased by his parents Jim and Myrna and will be dearly missed by his partner Sheila Chillson, stepdaughter Sonya (Duncan) and step-grandson Tyler, his brothers Michael (Liz) and Brian (Daphne), his beloved nephew and nieces and their partners: Mitchell (Sally), Alanna (Nick), Elyssa (Andrew), Adriana (Mario), and his faithful dog Lucas.A memorial service will be held at a later date.Donations in John's memory can be made to Madison Community Services, R.O.L.L. Aid Centre (Seeley's Bay Food Bank), or the Canadian Wildlife Federation.The family would like to thank the community home care nurses, and Dr. Ashe and the Palliative Care team at Brockville General Hospital for their attentive care and compassionate support during this difficult time.

(Ret)The family of Roderigue 'Roddy' LaFontaine regretfully announce his peaceful passing on Tuesday, January 30, 2024, in the early hours of the morning. His passing was peaceful and surrounded by love. Rod is survived by his loving wife Bonnie and proud dad of his sons Louis, Nathaniel, Joshua(Fiona) and Benjamin(Molly).Born April 14, 1936 in Waubaushene, Ontario, Rod's family moved to LaSalle in 1940. He is predeceased by his parents Omer and Evelyn (nee Burns) and siblings Edward, Vincent, Philip, Barbara, Dolores and Rosalee. Missed by his wife Bonnie (nee Roy), brothers Joey, Donnie and sister-in-law Joyce.Later, Rod graduated from the University of Guelph with a degree in Agricultural Science, the University of Toronto where he graduated in 1960 with a Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering and he then completed a Master's Degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Windsor. After completing his formal education, he went on to amass an impressive career with B.M. Ross and Associates, The City of Windsor, St. Clair College, and the Alberta Department of Transportation until 1986.Rod took great pride in his projects he took on after retirement. Being a co-founding member of the Maitland Trail Association in 1975 and reviving the Association on his return to Goderich in 1986. Rod also co-founded the Menesetung Bridge Association in 1990 which included a drive to save the abandoned CPR Menesetung Railway Bridge from demolition after meeting on New Years Eve with his wife, Bonnie and John Graham. They formulated the steering committee with John and Mary Lo Graham to Save the Bridge. He applied his engineering background to restore the bridge and turn it into a crossing for hikers and cyclists. He was the driving force behind this gorgeous landmark that exists today and can be enjoyed by all. For many years he worked to maintain the local trail system around Goderich including the landowner agreements and Provincial agreements for the Menesetung Bridge on the Tiger Dunlop Trail. He secured on-going funding for projects and published the Menesetung Bridge Newsletter. Rod was also an active member of the Knights of Columbus, the St. Peter's Church Choir, filmed Sunday masses for cable, and St. Peter's Cemetery groundskeeper.Rod spent many hours volunteering on the Goderich to Guelph Rail Trail Development, commonly known as 'G2G.'This project involved converting the 126 km abandoned rail corridor lands into a year-round recreational corridor. This linear park now accommodates walkers, hikers, and cyclists as well as snowmobile and ATV use in certain areas. Other trail and conservation projects he completed include Morris Tract, Millennium trail, Maitland woods, Sifto Trail loop and the designating the great 500 year old Heritage Oak Tree at the bottom of the Sifto Trail. He worked with various youth in programs such as EYC, Katimavik, the Willing Workers and the Ministry of the Solicitor General to help maintain the hiking trail system. He spent many years working himself on the same trails; maintaining and rehabilitating sections as needed.But Rod would say his greatest accomplishments are his children. From a very young age, Rod instilled great values, work ethic, and knowledge onto his children, who he lovingly referred to as 'varmits.' Some of his favourite activities included hiking andbiking, spending time with his family, and 'picking away' at salvage projects that he decided needed to 'come out of retirement.' He also enjoyed fixing projects that were 'buckshee' (half-assed) and always made sure to do it right the second time around. He also enjoyed taking time to savour the small moments and frequently said 'you don't have to do that now.' When it was time to work, everyone knew as he would yell 'lets get at-her' to rally the troops. He also enjoyed snacking on salty snacks while telling the boys 'these are too salty, you shouldn't eat these' and he would then finish the bag.The world has lost a wonderful man! Even though he is no longer with us, he will live on fondly in our memories forever.At Rod's request, cremation has taken place.

We have lost a loving father, son, brother, nephew, cousin, and friend.Born in Kenora on 15 July 1979, he was the elder son of Darwin & Gloria (nee: Innard) Harvie. He was predeceased by his father, both sets of grandparents - Dorothy & Henry Harvie and Margaret & David Innard, and cousins Devon Forsythe, Curtis Harvie & Rodney Harvie. Surviving are his mother, his brother James Harvie, his children Michael and Lilly Harvie and their mother, Jenn Barrette.David attended school at Valleyview, Evergreen, Lakewood, and Beaver Brae. Life long friends were made during these early years, playing clarinet in school band, acting in Shakespearean plays, and making movies with his friends. This interest in filmmaking led him to study Communications at the University of Windsor, while a part-time job in the duty-free shop on the Ambassador Bridge provided experience for his future career.During employment at various establishments (Rushing River Provincial Park, Keewatin Place, LCBO in Keewatin, Clearwater Bay and Kenora) Dave connected with staff and customers and his list of friendships grew. Outgoing, helpful, and reliable are descriptors for David's work ethic. He loved his job at the Kenora LCBO and was looking forward to getting back to it once he had beaten his cancer.David was a patient and kind father to Michael & Lilly. He enjoyed family game nights and was eager to share his hobbies with them. They were the light of his life and he treasured watching them grow and learn as he fostered their individuality.Dave was a man of eclectic interests. His music tastes ran from Marilyn Manson to Great Big Sea. He was an avid reader and was known to have 3 or 4 books on the go at once. He collected books by his favorite authors and was always on the hunt for the ones missing from his collection. David remained a student of film to the end - watching, critiquing, and learning from each one he viewed (Space Truckers was a favorite). He loved to play Magic Cards, D&D and other tabletop games. During long hospital stays he managed to arrange games with friends online. Besides books, Dave collected hats, pins, ties, beer cans, stamps, coins, and oddities from garage sales. He was a big fan of Sumo wrestling and anything Disney. He was a beer blogger and had an extensive collection of Port wine. Halloween was his favorite holiday with costume planning the highlight, not that he would wait until then to dress up.Dave was artistic and creative and had a unique sense of humour.  Although he was nostalgic about the past, he was also full of dreams for the future and had so many things he wanted to experience.  While his plans to travel in a double-decker bus didn't reach fruition, we expect his spirit is checking out Machu Picchu.The most amazing thing about David was his warrior spirit when it came to his three-year battle with cancer. With a positive outlook and a fierce determination, he took on each treatment and set back. He was and will always be, an inspiration to us all.Thank you to his care givers - doctors, nurses, friends, and family - who supported his journey.Due to current COVID restrictions, a celebration of David's life will take place next summer. In the meantime, remember his mantra - "every day is a gift".Flowers are gratefully declined. Memorial donations can be directed to the Terry Fox Foundation.

Don was born in Windsor, Ontario, December 24, 1949, to James and Florence Denver.Don is survived by his loving wife, Linda, with whom he had just celebrated 40 years of marriage with on June 9, 2019. He is also survived by his brother Larry Denver (Colleen), brother-in-law Gene Grant (Heather), sister-in-law Carol Keith, his daughters Alana Brown (Todd) and Lee Anne Hando (Dave), grandchildren, Jaymie Derouin (Jason), Tyler Neniska (Ralph), Lucas Brown (Cass), Nathan Brown, Myles Hando and Bryce Hando. Also, his great-grandsons, Keaton and Sutton Derouin, nephews, Ryan Grant (Carmen) and children, Riley Denver (Tina) and children and Peter Denver (Miranda) and children.Don was predeceased by his parents James and Florence Denver, in-laws Edward Grant, Alberta (Birdie) Grant and Daniel Mackie, as well as son-in-law, David Neniska and niece, Dayna Grant.Don attended school in Essex County, Ontario and Grade 13 in Belleville. From there he went on to attend the University of Windsor, University of Ottawa and the University of Waterloo. He worked at Service Canada and in Ottawa, Queen's Park in Toronto and moved on to be accepted at the Ontario Provincial Police College in 1977. Kenora was his first posting and this turned out to be his last.Don was a proud Canadian and Kenoraite and dedicated his entire career to serving his province and his community as a member of The Ontario Provincial Police. Having been posted here in 1977 from southern Ontario, he quickly developed strong community bonds and called Kenora his home. He was a born leader and those who knew and worked with him, will attest that he was great at his job. Fair and firm, with some laughs in between, he was always well respected among his colleagues and was missed around the office upon retirement. Don's last 3 years of his career before retirement were dedicated to the amalgamation of the city's police forces. He loved his job so much, we wondered if he would ever retire, but he finally did in 2009.Upon arrival in Kenora, he met Linda. She was swept her off her feet by the handsome and intelligent new recruit and there was no turning back. They married on June 9th, 1979 at Rabbit Lake and celebrated with close family and friends.As current and past President of the Alzheimer's Society, he learned about the disease that plagued his mother and worked to make a difference in the lives of those affected. Don was a past president of the Kenora Development Commission, a member of Making Kenora Home, the president of the Ontario Provincial Police Veterans Association - Kenora Chapter, and was deeply excited to be a new member of the Lake of the Woods Hospital Board and work to bring the vision of our healthcare and our hospital to fruition.Don and Linda enjoyed days on Lake of the Woods taking part in 'Escape' and LOWISSA, and made countless friends. Lake life was in their bones and they have enjoyed the lake for decades. They spent many weekends down the lake with the kids, especially for Thanksgiving which became a yearly tradition.No matter where he went, Don formed lifelong friendships. You knew where you stood with him. He was always so genuinely interested in what you had to say or how you were doing. He was our biggest fan, cheering us on with whatever it was we were doing. Many times, each of us would go to him for advice and we could always depend on a well thought out answer to guide us down our path. His sense of humour and keen timing telling a joke or a story, was part of what we loved so much about him. He was always just 'himself', dressing however or in whatever felt right at the time. We would tease him but he would just laugh and say, 'what would you like to drink'?Don was always happiest with family and friends around. It didn't matter one bit where it may be, as long as you were there. Don was a fantastic Grandpa and he dove into his role with zest and enjoyed each and everyone of his Grandkids to the fullest. He would be in the heap of it all as if he were reliving his childhood and at times more excited than some of the kids. He made everything an adventure and would take his Grandsons out every now and then for 'Man's Breakfast'. Don would drive around to gather up all the boys and treat them to whatever their heart desired. They all loved this and being the only Granddaughter, Jaymie didn't mind. When the first Great-grandson got old enough, he would enjoy it too. So many trips Linda and Don would go on with all of them in tow - places such as camping in Gimli, all the little towns in Manitoba, down by car to Toronto and Mackinac Island, Hawaii, Ottawa, London to visit his family and down through the states, just because. Don loved to drive and if he ever got lost, he would say he was taking 'the scenic route' and get back on track. Sometimes he'd unintentionally go through a red light and when Linda would call him on it, he'd say he was 'just getting organized'. So many stories to recall and memories shared.How do we sum up in a few paragraph's all that he was?He was everything. He was everything fun and beautiful and gentle and strong and joyful and brilliant in this world to us. We are left with a huge void in our lives and the coming days without him are going to be unbearably difficult. As we learn how to go on without him, we will look to each other and to our friends and think about how he would handle a situation like this.We would like to thank The Ontario Provincial Police, - Inspector Jeff Duggan, who hasn't left our side since the beginning. The Lake of the Woods District Hospital, Fire and Ambulance; your efforts were valiant and Don would be so proud of you all.

His family has been by his side surrounding him with love and care during his brave battle with brain cancer for the past 17 months. Jeff was born in Toronto, Ontario in 1965, the eldest of two children raised by parents Mary (Sullivan) and Gary Locke. He was predeceased by his mother and sister Patty. Proudly carrying on Jeff's enduring love of family and sport are, his father Gary Locke; wife Rachelle Matic; daughter Mateja and son Aiden. He will be lovingly remembered by extended family and many friends. The principles of discipline, perseverance and loyalty guided Jeff to become an accomplished athlete, to achieve academic and career success, and most importantly, to be a devoted husband and father. In Toronto, he attended Blessed Trinity Elementary School and St. Michael's College School for Boys. At Western University, he received a BA in Economics, then a Masters in Business Administration from the University of Windsor and finally, many designations in the financial services industry. Raised in a family of professional and Olympic athletes, as well as, sport enthusiasts, Jeff's interest in both individual and team sports started early and continued for the whole of his life. As a youth, he played hockey in the Toronto Hockey League competing throughout the city and surrounding areas. He represented St. Michael's in hockey, football and wrestling. Challenging further his mental/physical limits, he later trained for and participated in triathlons across southern Ontario. After finishing Ironman Canada twice in Penticton, Jeff gained eligibility to partake in the Boston Marathon and the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii. While subsequently walking away from athletic pursuits, Jeff never forsook the pleasure of being physically active. As a dedicated insurance professional since 1993, he held various titles in Great West Life, Investors Group, Cumis, Desjardins Financial Security, and finally Manulife. His primary role was to work closely with all distribution channels to provide training, education, coaching and joint sales case work on insurance products. In this capacity, Jeff travelled across Canada where he regularly encountered a small network of colleagues; many of which he formed enduring friendships with. While Jeff loved his work, much joy came from being with his family as a dedicated, caring husband and father. Of all his titles and accomplishments, Jeff put forth the greatest effort into and earned the most fulfillment from that of "Super Hero Daddy". He devoted much energy coaching Mateja and Aiden in hockey and ball, as a spectator and cheerleader for their other sports and simply in play. God could not have blessed them with a more attentive, loving father, and for that we are grateful. Special thanks to Dr. Kumar, the Allan Blair Cancer Clinic, the Palliative Care Program and Grace Hospice for their exemplary care. Prayers will be held at Speers Funeral Chapel, 2136 College Avenue, Regina, SK, on Monday, November 13, 2017 at 7:00 p.m. Funeral Mass will be held at Resurrection R.C.

Her life, marked by achievements in science, athletics and public service earned her significant recognition. She was a proud Canadian with her roots firmly planted in Saskatchewan.She leaves to mourn two aunts: Annie (John) Romaniuk, Yorkton; and Mary (Fred) Romaniuk, Parksville, BC as well as cousins: Dolores (Tom) Murphy, Vancouver; Garry Vann (Carol Walker), Saskatoon; Michael (Margaret) Vann, Calgary; Alvina Romaniuk, Spruce Grove, AB; Eugene (Coby) Romaniuk, Errington, BC; Sharon (Steve) Sobkow, Calder, SK; Lawrence (Susan) Romaniuk, Kelowna; Metro (Adelaine) Romaniuk, Yorkton; Ivan & Regina Sobkow (Nicholas & Vincent), Calder, SK; Andrea Sobkow, Saskatoon; Charlotte & Bill Patterson (Jennifer), Qualicum Beach, BC; Douglas & Christine Heshka-Wolf (Ciera & Kira), Spruce Grove, AB; Sandra & Dwayne Yachiw (Samanda & Amanda), Saskatoon. Also left to mourn are many friends, especially Irene Bell and her best friend Max C. Sylvia was predeceased by her parents Theodore and Annie and her special cousin, Merylyn Vann.Sylvia was born in Canora, Saskatchewan on May 5, 1927 to Annie Romaniuk and Theodore Fedoruk. A spring blizzard struck just as Mrs. Fedoruk went into labour forcing the shorter trip to Canora hospital rather than Yorkton as they planned. The circumstances surrounding Sylvia's birth became a metaphor for managing adversity that defined the Fedoruks who, like many at the time, overcame significant hardship to become firmly established first-generation Canadians.Sylvia's early school experiences, where circumstances frequently compromised the curriculum, were balanced by personallessons that would serve her well in her later academic pursuits. Her formal education began in a one room rural school, near Wroxton in the Yorkton area, where her father taught seventy students in grades one to eight while supervising those completing gradesnine and ten by correspondence. Older students helped teach the younger ones so that by the time she was in grade five, Sylviawas helping "tutor" her younger classmates. Her father, determined to show that his daughter was not the teacher's pet, used Sylviato set the academic and disciplinary standards for the school. Pursuing the best grades and pleasing supervisors would define her career with impressive results.In 1941 the Fedoruks moved to Windsor, Ontario where both parents found work. Canada was at war and factory wages were much higher than Theodore could earn as a rural school teacher. Here, Sylvia completed grades nine through thirteen, graduating in 1946 as the top female student at Walkerville Collegiate, earning the Ernest J. Creed Memorial Medal and a University entrance scholarship.The family returned to Saskatchewan after the war where Theodore resumed his teaching career and Sylvia enrolled at the Universityof Saskatchewan. She never forgot her mother's message that she complete a University education, find a satisfactory job andstick with it to earn a good pension, opportunities that had eluded the ambitious, hard-working Annie. Supported by scholarships and her parents' hard-earned savings, Sylvia obtained her B.A. with great distinction, in 1949, earning the Governor General's Gold Medalas the University's most outstanding graduate. This was followed by a four-year degree with high honours in Physics and a Masters degree in 1951.By this time, she had caught the attention of Dr. Harold Johns who recruited her to be the radiation physicist at the Saskatoon Cancer Clinic. Her work with Johns, teaching medical physics and pioneering the world's first cobalt unit to treat cancer, earned her an international reputation. By the time Sylvia retired in 1986, she was Director of Physics Services for the Saskatchewan Cancer Commission, had published 38 refereed papers and had participated in scientific presentations world-wide.She was the first female member of the Atomic Energy Control Board of Canada (1973-83) and the Science Council, Canada (1973-76), was appointed an Honourary Member of the Canadian Association of Radiologists, a Fellow of the Canadian College of Physicists in Medicine and Honourary Consultant to the medical staff of Royal University Hospital where she spent her career. Her work in medical radiology earned her four honourary degrees from the University of Windsor (1987), Western Ontario (1990), Regina (1991) and Mount Saint Vincent (1993). A fifth, recognizing her career and public service contributions was awarded in 2006 by her alma mater, the University of Saskatchewan. In 1986, Sylvia was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada and received the Saskatchewan Order of Merit. Her career was captured best in 1988 when she was selected to the Order of St. John, an international organization whose mission is to prevent illness and enhance the health and well-being of people throughout the world. In 2009, she was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame and was awarded the Queen's Jubilee Medal in 2012. Not bad for a girl who began her education in a one room school near Wroxton, Saskatchewan.Sylvia's public service record is as impressive as her career. Her name is found on an assortment of fifty-one directorships ranging from University of Saskatchewan contributions on the Board of Governors, the Senate and a term as Chancellor to participation in the wider community. She was a member of The Meewasin Foundation, Ronald McDonald House, and the Centennial Auditorium (TCU Place) Boards and the planning committee for the 1989 Brier. Provincially, she served on the Board of Sask. Sport and was a member of the Advisory Committee for Judicial Appointments. A term as President of the Canadian Ladies' Curling Association and on the Board of the Canadian Nurses Association enhanced her national reputation. Her varied public service contributions culminated in her appointment as Saskatchewan's seventeenth and first woman Lieutenant Governor. Like anything else she did, her 1988-1994 term was completed with dignity, warmth and distinction. She was one of Saskatchewan's most popular Lieutenant Governors.Accomplishments in science and public service were complemented by Sylvia's long-term involvement in sports. In her academic and public services roles, she was "Professor" or "Your Honour". When she arrived at the curling rink, arena, gymnasium or golf course, she became "Syl".In the days before specialization, Sylvia was an outstanding University athlete. Including four track and field championships highlighted by a 1947 Canadian record in women's javelin, she won a total of twelve intervarsity championships. In 1949 she was awarded the Spirit of Youth Trophy for outstanding accomplishments in academics and athletics. Following graduation, she turned to softball and curling with similar success. In the days before national championships, she was an infielder on the Regina Govins and the Saskatoon Ramblers 1954 and 1955 Western Canadian Championship teams. She was on curling teams skipped by Joyce McKee that won three Provincial championships and the first Canadian Championship in 1961. Golf remained an interest from her early university days through her various "retirements" where she maintained a membership at Riverside Country Club. At the University level, she remained a life-long passionate supporter of the basketball Huskies, an early arrival for games and never shy about scolding the referees.Helen Keller, author, lecturer, activist and first deaf and blind person to graduate from college more than a century ago said "I long to accomplish great and noble tasks but it is my duty to accomplish small tasks as though they were great and noble". Sylvia Fedoruk's life was marked by tasks large and small and accomplishments great and noble. We mourn her passing and celebrate her life.A State Funeral will be held in Saskatoon, SK on Friday, October 5, 2012 at 2:00 p.m. at TCU Place (35 - 22nd Street East).

The only child of Violetta and Edwin Raby, Stewart was born in Ossett, Yorkshire, UK, and immigrated to Canada in 1965 to take up a career as a professor, a scholar, and a leading authority on First Nations' land claims. He is survived by his partner of the past 24 years, Alison Lohans and their son Chris Lohans (Che Colpitts) all of Regina; by his daughter Rebecca Raby (Holly Patterson) and their son Levi Patterson-Raby of St. Catharines, ON; by his son Andrew Raby (Alli Porter) of Vancouver, BC; by Alison's son John Lohans of Saskatoon; and by his former wife Helen McFadden of Surrey, BC. Stewart prepared for life as a scholar by earning one degree from Oxford University and another from the University of Alberta, before earning his PhD in geography from the University of Wales at Swansea. New doctorate in hand he immigrated to Canada in 1965, teaching first at the University of Saskatchewan, then at the University of Windsor, and finally in Ottawa. While in Ottawa, Stewart was hired as a Senior Researcher for the 1969 Barber Commission inquiry into Indian land claims, and began his life's work. The Barber Commission job led to a staff position with the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN) in the early 1980s, where he served as Head Researcher on specific claims. Over the years, his work with FSIN was instrumental in the resolution of many important claims throughout Saskatchewan. Though raised in the Church of England, Stewart became a convinced Quaker (Religious Society of Friends) and was an influential member of Regina Allowed Meeting and Prairie Monthly Meeting. Music and literature were passions; his tall, lean frame with its shock of white hair a familiar presence at book launches, readings and concerts in Regina. We grieve his passing, but his legacy of scholastic service and commitment to social justice and the delight he took in sharing beautiful music and fine literature leaves the world better than he found it. Memorial Service will be held at 7 p.m., Friday, August 7, 2009 at Speers Family Centre, 2333 Cornwall Street, Regina, SK. The family suggests that a donation to the Saskatchewan Council for International Co-operation 2138 McIntyre St, Regina, S4P 2R7 would further work that was important to Stewart.

Beloved grandpa of Sydney, Garrett, Olivia and Callum Atkinson; Joshua Kimsa (Kristine) and Kailey Kimsa; Zachary Cressman (Kim), Connor Cressman (Ashley) and Krista Van Slingerland (Evan). Sweet great-grandfather to Grayson Cressman.Predeceased by his parents, Ervin C. & Eliza Jane (Lillian) Atkinson (nee Ferguson), brothers Delbert Atkinson (Sharon) & Roy Atkinson (Nell), sister Joyce Walker (Allan).Survived by sister Ruth Hisey-Rafati (Joe).Howard grew up on a farm in rural Ontario in the Creemore-Stayner area. From a young age, he knew the farming life was not for him, so after high school, he headed to Kitchener, hiring on with a repo company (a job he hated) before joining Bell Canada, where he would spend 32 years in sales & management. Upon retiring from Bell, Howard went to work for the City of London as Business Development Manager, & was well into his eighties when he ended his working career as Director of Project Development with MCI Design-Build Corporation.He had a lifelong love of reading, learning & education, eventually completing his BA as a mature student at the University of Windsor. All things history was a passion for him, with JFK being a particular fascination.Beyond being driven to succeed at work, Howard was also active in many community efforts: from the numerous Better Business Bureaus & Chambers of Commerce he joined in multiple cities, to adding his voice & business acumen to numerous boards & committees. He was active in coaching his son in baseball & hockey, & whenever possible, he could be found rooting for kids & grandkids at their many sporting activities.In his spare time, Howard was known to squeeze in the 'occasional round' of golf & games of poker. An avid sports fan, he watched many Blue Jays' games on TV & ever the optimist, never gave up cheering for his beloved Toronto Maple Leafs, though his faithfulness was rewarded with decades of heart break.Multiple family trips are remembered fondly, from the annual vacations to Long Point cottages & March Break trips to Florida, to enjoying Expo '67 in Montreal, & a Maritime holiday to see Peggy's Cove, Anne of Green Gables, magnetic hill & the Bay of Fundy.He will be sadly missed by our family, extended family members, friends, former colleagues & neighbours.

She leaves her siblings Janis, Jon, Greg, and Julie; brothers-in-law Ray and David; nieces and nephews Raphael, Kim, Gail, Fiona and Thomas; and her great-nephew Gabriel.Paula was born in Windsor, attended King Edward and Ada C. Richards public schools, Herman Collegiate and the University of Windsor, developing many lifelong friendships at every stage. At age 21 she began a fulfilling career as an elementary school teacher. For over three decades, in Windsor, Toronto and London, she nurtured children's confidence, joy for learning, and love of reading. Later in her career she provided one-on-one tutoring and play therapy.Paula's nieces and nephews meant the world to her, and she was an integral part of their childhood and development-cheering them on at races, music performances and graduations. She offered her calm presence in many quiet hours of school work and life preparation, and supported them in all their milestones, large or small. Her dog Jesse gave her much comfort and companionship, and her charm and friendliness shone as she and Jesse walked the neighbourhood. She enjoyed all kinds of travel: camping in Ontario's parks, European river cruises, or practicing her French in Paris. She joined meditation groups, sang alto beautifully, and danced whenever she could. But most of all she was deeply happy around a feast table with family, or a board game table with any who would agree to one more round.Her family wishes to thank the dedicated health care providers and wonderful friends who sustained Paula to the end. We mourn the loss of a precious sister, aunt and friend, but cherish the laughter and memories she gave us.Paula hosted her own delightful celebration of life four months ago; at her request there will be no funeral.

We miss him so much already.Chris was born at Grace Hospital in Windsor, Ontario, on July 13, 1946, to Mary and George Morgan. As a child, Chris (aka Kit) was twinkly eyed, spritely, curious, and energetic. He loved the outdoors and took an interest in sports. He was the middle child, growing up with his older sister Susan, and younger brother Charlie.He happily recalled many childhood stories about growing up on Alexandra Street in Windsor with his brother, sister, parents, and nanny, as well with the neighbourhood gang and his best boyhood friends Read Collacott and Hughie Nolan.He was a ferocious football player, and a stand-out baseball player and (outdoor) ice hockey player. He often recalled stories of strapping/taping on Sears catalogues to his knees as his hockey pads. Some memorable childhood highlights include cheering for the Detroit Tigers, Red Wings hockey games at Olympia Stadium in Detroit, golf with his father, and spending time with his nanny (his maternal grandmother with whom the family lived). He attended Vincent Massey Collegiate and worked part-time at Chrysler during his high school years. He played high school-level basketball, football, and baseball, and later was a varsity basketball player.He completed his BA and BPHE at the University of Windsor, BEd at Althouse College in London Ontario, and MA at the University of Western in London. After his formal education was completed, he moved to Harrow, Ontario. His first position as an educator was teaching Physical Education and Outdoor Education and coaching Track and Field, Volleyball, and Wrestling at Centennial Highschool in Windsor. His teaching career spanned nearly 40 years and included time at Albert College (Belleville) and at LPH, Oakridge, Ross, and Westminster Secondary Schools in London. He is remembered by many students over the years as their favorite teacher. He made an impact on, and was a role model for, hundreds of students and has been described as original, positive, kind, inspiring, compassionate, enthusiastic, influential, having boundless energy, a guiding light, his teaching unparalleled, the best(!), and truly someone making a difference and changing the trajectory of their lives. Many of his students became life-long friends (they know who they are).His interests and involvement in sailing grew after he crewed for Duncan Hind at Southport Sailing Club on Lake St. Clair. He bought his own sailboat (a Shark), became an accomplished sailor, and was involved with racing on weekends for many years. His love of physical and outdoor education led to his many years as an active marathon runner, triathlete, canoe/kayaker, sailing instructor, mountain climber, white-water rapids instructor, back country camper/hiker, winter camper/quinzhee maker, and cross country skier. In his later years he got out for his daily walks exploring London and his neighbourhood.His love of, and involvement in, sports was life-long. He led a very physically active life and loved coaching, playing, and watching all sports. He coached community sports in Windsor, Belleville, London, and Grand Bend. He loved wrestling, hockey, football, and basketball. He was most especially a baseball fan, cheering for the Detroit Tigers his whole life.He was incredibly creative. He loved music, painting, sketching, model building, making art, and he was fascinated by art and literature. He spent several years working on his creative hobby and part-time business of silk-screening/printmaking. He was an avid reader and history buff, and he took great interest in war studies, social sciences, humanities, Canadian studies, and politics.He was a home renovation specialist and became more interested in wood working and wood tuning as he got older. He took pride in taking care of the different homes he owned. He created hundreds of beautiful pieces in his shop over the years including specialty Windsor chairs, tables, cabinets, bowls, and sculptures. He spent the last few years of his life turning his home into a beautiful oasis for himself and his partner, Eva Morgan (Lambkin), whom he married in 2017.He was so incredibly proud of his children, Sally (born 1975) and Jake (born 1978), who were a big part of his life. He passed on his love of the fine arts, outdoor education, sports, history, and culture, to both his children and grandchildren. In the last several years he really enjoyed being able to witness his grandchildren play sports, sing, and play their musical instruments.Dad had many friends. Whether childhood friends, students, colleagues, friends of his children, those he met through his adventures on the water, in the woods, on the mountains, through academic pursuits, and in the many places that he lived, he loved and appreciated them all.Let's just say, a lot of families had an "Uncle Chris".He was eccentric. He was a storyteller, an improvisor, and a curious soul, in search of knowledge, truth, and love. He was smart, rebellious, stubborn, and feisty. He was not perfect and struggled with many things in life, like we all do. He tried his very best to be his most authentic self and continued each day to become the man he was meant to be.He was surrounded and held by the love and support of his children, his daughter-in-law Mercedes, son-in-law Neil, his grandchildren, his partner, his brother, sister, and nieces/nephews in his final days. He knew how very much he was loved.You weren't ready to leave. We know you had many more years to share with us and that they were cut far too short. We are at a loss without you, and we will carry you in our hearts forever.Dad died on April 1, 2023, in London, Ontario, at 11:35 am. He was predeceased by his mother Mary Jane Morgan (Miller), his father George Delbert Morgan, and his brother-in-law and close friend, Gerry Hess.He is survived by those who are deeply mourning his passing: his children Sally Morgan (Neil Balan) and Jake Morgan (Mercedes Morgan), and their mother, Donna Moser; his wife, Eva Morgan (children Sara and Dante); his sister, Susan Hess, and brother, Charlie Morgan (Cathy Morgan); his four beloved grandchildren Evangeline, Jack, Miles, and Alexandra; and his nieces and nephews Christopher (Justine), Matthew (Catherine), Sarah, Leah, Rachel, Lindsay (Rob), and Andrea (Sean Patrick).Extra special thanks to the superhero nurses, doctors, respirology team, respiratory therapists, specialists, CCOT team, and all the support staff at Victoria Hospital in London who did everything they could to care for him.

It was so heart wrenching to know that Kristin didn't believe anything or anyone would be able to help her. After years of battling her own demons along with the bureaucracy of our mental healthcare system  the system that she so passionately fought for  failed her.Kristin will be deeply missed by her Father, Ed Donkers (Shedden), Grandparents, Leo and Joanne Donkers (St. Thomas), her Brothers, Krystian and Krystopher Donkers (Shedden) and her Best Friend, Charlie, her cat. She now rests in the loving arms of her Mother, Coreen Legault and Grandpapa, Carman Legault.Kristin was grateful for all the love and compassion from her friends, most especially to Antonette for always being there to listen and support her during the darkest of times  she believed in Kristin when she couldn't believe in herself. Kate, was one of the few people throughout her life who truly understood how unbearable her depression was  she knew how to empathize with her daily struggles.Kristin is survived by her Grandmamma Claudette Legault (Cornwall), Uncles Craig Legault and Robert Donkers (Stephanie), Aunts Carolyn Legault (Ralph), Debbie Legault, and Mary Donkers, cousins Vanessa, Victoria, Alexander, Owen, Kian, Taylor and Lauren. She will also be missed by her friends, her schoolmates, her colleagues, and by those of us who looked to her for inspiration with our own battles with mental illness.Kristin was a first year Master of Social Work student and Graduate Assistant at the University of Windsor. She recently earned her Undergraduate Degree in Psychology and Disability Studies from King's University College at Western University. Her future plan was to pursue Law School Studies for an eventual legal career in public policy, mental health and disability rights law and advocacy.Kristin had a fervent passion for mental health advocacy and creating systemic change. As an advocate, an author, a crisis responder, a lecturer and a lobbyist, we are incredibly proud of her accomplishments:Recipient of the Sharon Johnston Champion of Mental Health for Youth Award through the Canadian Alliance on Mental Illness and Mental Health (CAMIMH) in 2018 for Mental Health Advocacy work in her community. #BellLetsTalkRecipient of the London-Middlesex Mental Health Champion Award through St. Joseph's Health Care and CMHA Middlesex in 2018 for her commitment to Mental Health Advocacy in the London Community.Co-Developed a comprehensive Educational Package designed to facilitate discussions around Mental Health for elementary school-aged students.Co-Founded Reading to Flourish, a Mental Health-Related Reading Initiative for young children and their families during the COVID pandemic.Received grants to fund 100 Mental Health "Coping Toolkits" for CMHA Middlesex Clients experiencing a Mental Health/Addictions Crisis.Authored a series of illustrated children's books on mental health.https://www.childrensmentalhealthseries.com/Co-Chair of the London Police Services Board of Mental Health and Addictions Advisory Panel 2021Forever in our hearts, Kristin's legacy as a mental health advocate will live on as a dark and shining example of much needed change in our mental health care system. She tirelessly lobbied for legislative parity between mental and physical Health.While Kristin's words 'Is anyone ever going to help me?' echo in our ears, sadly it seems to be unheard for years from our mental health care and health care system.

It was her Grandma who stood by her, was her biggest champion, her guardian angel, never wavering in her belief in all that Kristin could be. Joanne and Leo's love for Kristin remains unconditional and absolute during this heartbreaking time. Kristin will always be our baby girl.You may now truly REST IN PEACE Kristin."Suicide is not selfish. Suicide is normally, death caused by the illness of depression.It is the final symptom. A  final collapse under unbearable Weight. Suicide is a tragedy.If you have never been close to that edge try not to judge What you can't understand."A Celebration Of Life for Kristin will be held at a later date.Williams Funeral Home, 45 Elgin St., St. Thomas entrusted with arrangements.		t	NULL	NULL	42.9837	-81.2497

He is also lovingly remembered by his sons, David Leo Tracey and Andrew Brian Tracey; their wives, Ashley Harding and Julianna Tracey (Pulzoni); his brother, Richard Tracey; and his sister-in-law, Cheryl Palmer-Tracey. Brian was the proud and adoring grandfather of Ava Margaret (Tracey) and Emerson Brian (Tracey-Harding); loving uncle to many nieces and nephews; and a cherished brother-in-law to the many Van Sickle siblings. He was predeceased by his parents, Richard and Lucille Tracey (Tourangeau). Brian was born in Windsor, Ontario on March 24, 1940. His early childhood was spent in London, Ontario, attending St. Martin's, St. Patrick's, and St. Peter's Elementary Schools. In 1955, he entered the Redemptorist Junior Seminary in Brockville, Ontario, and later studied at Holy Redeemer College, associated with The University of Windsor. Brian was ordained in 1965, though ultimately decided to leave the priesthood. He later attended Teacher's College in London, Ontario and achieved a Master's Degree in Education from The University of Western Ontario in 1981. For 28 years, Brian taught grades four through eight for the London District Catholic School Board at a number of schools, including St. Kevin's, St. Anthony's, Sir Arthur Carty, St. Patrick's, St. Thomas More, and St. Marguerite d'Youville. He retired in 1999, becoming a stay-at-home "Pa" to his beloved sons. A genuinely sweet, empathetic, and compassionate man, Brian was always actively engaged in supporting his sons' many activities; he enjoyed attending their various football and hockey games, theatrical performances, and concerts. He was an avid reader, a sports fan, and a connoisseur of both seafood and ice cream. Over the years, Brian and Martha enjoyed attending live theatre and musical performances, quiet dinners out together, and many family gatherings. Brian also enjoyed traveling with Martha, having most recently visited Europe in September, 2011. Brian's health began to deteriorate in 2013 with a series of strokes. Martha cared for him unwaveringly until he finally succumbed to related complications. Over this time, Brian never allowed his suffering to embitter him. He continued to greet all visitors with the widest of smiles and an enthusiastic "Hi!". He retained to the end his sense of humour and his love of friends and family, always taking great joy in his time with Martha, teasing his boys, snuggling with his cats, and most recently, his newborn grandchildren. A gentle soul, Brian was ever peaceful, caring, loving, and kind. He will be missed deeply, remembered lovingly, and carried always in our hearts. A Celebration of Life will be held at a later date.

He fought with grace and humour throughout his long and courageous battle with cancer.John was born in London, Ontario on April 14, 1939 to loving parents, Eileen and Roy, and joined his sister Royleen. His biggest joy was his immediate family. He was married to Anne for over 51 years and she was his soldier, cheerleader, and his best friend. He would boast to anyone and everyone about his children: Mark (Lara), Johanna (Tomas) and Jonathan (Moshi). He was so proud of them, their accomplishments and always thought they got their smarts from him. He took great pleasure watching his four grandchildren, Quinn, Parker, Nash and Ryder, growing up. They all loved Poppa's magical ways and they will forever look for the rainbow sent by him to make them smile.He loved the early morning; he was always the first one to rise, make coffee or go for breakfast with one of his many friends, read the paper, and check the local news and do his crossword.He grew up in Old South London in simpler times, going for Jumbo ice cream on Saturday nights or playing basketball until sunset with friends. Those endless hours of practice led him to become an exceptional athlete on the basketball court but he also excelled at football, track and tennis. John was often the youngest on the teams but generally the best. He became captain of his high school teams, developing both his leadership and social skills that would serve him well as Student Council President of South Collegiate.During those teenage years, he met Dunc, Scottie and JC, his best friends for 68 years. They shared many meals together, and traveled to many countries, cottages, and boys-only golf trips. He took great joy in these deep friendships.As a young man, John took great pride in being a City of London Playground Supervisor for numerous summers. This is where he met Nashy, Diz, Clarky, Tommy, Prousie, Donna, and Marni. Friendship became a key element to John's happiness right behind his family.At the University of Windsor, where he went for a Physical Education degree, he met the love of his life, Anne. Together they developed more lasting friendships with the Nashs, Semotiuks, Williamsons, Whites, and Girvans. From playing bridge, having endless dinners, laughing or drinking too much scotch, these friends lasted a lifetime. We often joked that John was like the Mayor of London because he always knew someone everywhere he went. He had a special spark and connection with everyone he met.John went on to become a caring educator at the elementary, secondary and university levels in London and Middlesex County. He mentored many colleagues and students along the way and proudly ended his career as a Vice Principal to step into the favourite part of his life, retirement. With more time for family and friends, he became a better golfer, and mastered the art of stained glass. He loved travelling with Anne, sitting on the balcony of a cruise ship, listening to the ocean in Myrtle Beach, sipping coffee and people watching in Italy, or golfing with friends amid the gorgeous Irish scenery.We are so proud to have had John in our lives, as a father, husband, and best friend. We  will never forget his compassionate ways. He has left this earth a better place.The McLean family would like to thank the outstanding staff at LHSC, especially Dr. Chin and Dr. George Kim.

She wrote poetry and took an interest in philosophy and theology, often helping her husband editing his academic publications. She enjoyed spending time with her many close friends.

After the death of her husband, Harry, she moved first to Nelson, BC, then to the west coast near Duncan, BC, where she passed away not far from the Pacific. The family are extremely grateful to the dedicated caregivers at Dovehill House in Chemainus, BC, and Cerwydden House in Duncan, BC, and to Dr. Tanis Morris.

The proud daughter of Alexander (Sandy) Watson   and Johann (Lowther) of London, June introduced them to the joys of Christian life to add to their fine home life, interaction with friends, and their love of travel and of horses. On her marriage to Rev. Vogan on June 9, 1951 after his graduation from Western University and Huron College, they began their parish life service. June assumed responsibilities of an Anglican minister's wife when Rev.

June provided enthusiastic support for new clergy and followed their progress. She was a long-time and continuing member of St. Matthews Young Women's Association that had dwindled to the Group of Seven.

Born in Syracuse, N.Y., he was a son ofthe late Samuel and Charlotte (Wolkov) Mallov. Jon graduated from William Nottingham High School in Syracuse, N.Y., and went on to attend University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.; Queen's University, Kingston, Ont., and University of Windsor, Windsor, Ont. He took various jobs in the accounting field and because he wanted to live in Canada, and had connections in Truro, when the position of Firm Administrator became available at Burchell MacDougall Law Firm, he applied and was accepted. He moved his young family to Truro in December 1988, and enjoyed working at the law firm until his retirement in 2016.Travelling was one of Jon's main interests and he went to New York City on several occasions to meet with old friends and enjoy the city. After meeting Sherri, he took her along. Sherri and Jon travelled together to San Francisco, Calif.; Yellowknife, N.W.T.; Edmonton, Alta.; and on to Vancouver and Portland, Ore., via train. They also travelled to Scotland twice; Ireland, and almost yearly by train to Jon's "spiritual home" in Montreal. He managed to find jazz clubs and second-hand bookstores in most of the places he visited. Jon was known locally for his great saxophone sound. He had played the sax since he was 12 years old and could pick up a tune from any band he sat in with. His Parkinson's disease diagnosis of 2012 made it more difficult to play, but he persevered and was even able to record and post a short addition to the Ultimate Online Nova Scotia Kitchen Party on Facebook. Reading obscure novels was another of Jon's pastimes. He found some real treasures on his excursions to second-hand bookstores. Since he had read so many, he decided to try his hand at writing and so "The Deal" was born. It is a murder mystery set in his beloved Montreal and is in the hands of the publisher for review. To get the necessary exercise every day he took his best fur pal, Leo, for a walk around downtown Truro. To relax, he poured himself a good scotch and put a CD in his stereo. He had quite a collection, but especially enjoyed listening to various jazz musicians, many of whom he saw in person. Jon was dedicated to his five sons and was so proud of their varied and unique accomplishments. He enjoyed participating in their Minor Hockey adventures, sometimes driving in less than optimal conditions. There were family trips to NHL games to watch his favorite team, the Montreal Canadiens. The Detroit Red Wings were second in line for his attention. It was a pleasure having the boys at the house for dinners and special occasions. He made a point to stay in contact frequently with each of them. Jon welcomed his stepchildren and grandchildren as his own. He was always interested in their lives and encouraged and assisted when needed. Jon was a gentle, kind and generous person who endeared himself to most people he knew. He had special connections to former colleagues from his time working in the USA and enjoyed close friendships with his Truro "surrogate family". Surviving are his wife, Sherri (Lynds); sons, Ian (Chloe), Toronto; James, Halifax; Ross, Truro; Stephen, Truro; Daniel, Halifax; stepchildren, Lori Holman (Nate), Noel Shore; Adam Holman (Vivek), Calgary; Jonathan Knight, Truro; grandchildren,Nicholas Gorman, Tyler Gorman and Ella Henderson, all of Truro; brother, Joe (Karen) Mallov, Portland, Ore.; and one niece, two nephews and their families. Cremation has taken place under the direction of Arimathea Funeral Cooperative, Upper Musquodoboit. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, a gathering will be held at a later date.

Steve was a loving husband and father, a skilled and dedicated surgeon, a devout Christian, and in his spare time an avid gardener. He is much loved by his wife Dorothy, his three sons, Steven, Bradley, and Dale, his daughters-in-law AiLinh Trinh (Steven) and Dr. Stephanie Young (Bradley), and his grandchildren Noah and Gavin (Steven), and Claire, Paige, and Andrew (Bradley). Steve was born and raised in Windsor; his parents, Helen and Daniel, were hard working immigrants from Hungary and were proud that both Steve and his older brother Aurel became doctors. Steve had many fond memories of the University of Western Ontario, where not only did he complete his medical and surgical training (MD, 1959), but also met Dorothy Torrance, the operating room nurse who became the love of his life. He was a caring surgeon in the city of Windsor for 36 years (1966-2002); incredibly committed (many times in the middle of the night waking up and racing to the hospital to perform emergency surgery, and remarkably always in good spirits to greet his children the next morning), Steve was equally well known for his surgical aptitude. Indeed, he was the first surgeon in Ontario to successfully re-implant an amputated hand, and also introduced neonatal surgery to Windsor, successfully operating on infants weighing as little as 2 lbs. Dr. Radin was Chief of Surgery for 17 years, first at Windsor Regional Hospital and then at Grace Hospital, where he was well loved by the nurses and staff for his kindness. Steve is a past President of the Essex County Medical Society as well as the Southwestern Ontario Surgical Association. Steve was also interested in sports medicine, having served as a ring-side physician in both boxing and wrestling; in particular he was a member of the Canadian delegation in the 1972 and 1976 Olympics - one of Steve's most cherished moments was walking into the Olympic stadium with the Canadian Olympic Team as a physician at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Ever since his childhood the church has held a very important place in Steve's heart; beginning with the active participation of Steve's parents in Windsor's Romanian church, as an adult he went on to 30 years of active membership in Temple Baptist Church, and then became an active member of Banwell Community Church. He was Chair of the Board of Trustees of Temple Baptist Church for 19 years and was a Sunday School teacher for 12 years of those years. Steve continually contributed to his community. He served with the Victorian Order of Nurses (VON) in Windsor-Essex County over the last 40 years: first as a medical advisor, then as a member of the Board of Directors, and finally as President of the Endowment Foundation. He also served on the Board of Governors of the University of Windsor and the Board of Trustees of the McMaster University Divinity School. Dr. Radin put his surgical skills to good use in some of the poorest parts of the world through volunteering as a surgeon in mission hospitals in India, Nepal, and China. A Memorial Service will be held at Banwell Community Church, 2400 Banwell Road, Windsor, at 11am on Saturday, March 27, 2010.

Brother of Lynn Wilson (Jack     predeceased), Patricia Boll (Harry predeceased) and Nicki Moffatt (Grant). Also lovingly remembered by many nieces and nephews. Cherished friend to his assistant, Glenn Rudd. Gerry was raised on Manitoulin Island where he was known locally (and then nationally) as an exceptional athlete. Gerry attended Assumption University of Windsor on a double sports scholarship for football and hockey. After receiving his Honours Bachelor of Commerce, Gerry continued in his father's entrepreneurial footsteps opening the first of many businesses in Espanola. An unfortunate accident in 1965 resulted in Gerry becoming a paraplegic, but that only encouraged him to continue providing opportunities for his family and to others. He opened Consumers Distributing in Sudbury, and shortly after, the Manpower franchise in Sudbury in 1967, remaining the President until his unexpected passing. Gerry also served as both a member and a Director on the Ontario Advisory Council for the Physically Handicapped, as well as countless other Boards, volunteer committees and in special Advisory roles for other entrepreneurs. Gerry will be fondly remembered for always having a story to tell, making contacts wherever he went and as a wealth of information on almost any subject. He had a personal quest to be a life long learner but his family was his passion and his eyes always twinkled a little more when he spoke of his grandchildren. A brief graveside service for Gerry will be held on Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 2:00 p.m. at the Espanola Cemetery.

She passed away surrounded by her loving family. Mary was 62.Mary was born at Windsor's Grace Hospital on July 9, 1958 to Barbara and George Gall. She attended Walkerville Collegiate Institute where, in 1970, she met her future husband Mark Wilkinson. Destined to shape young minds, she gave the Valedictory Address to her graduating class in 1976. Mary attended the University of Windsor and, following her passion, graduated in 1980 with a degree in Honours English Literature and Linguistics. She was awarded the gold medal for highest academic standing in her major, an accomplishment born of both hard work and a true love of learning. She carried this enthusiasm forward to the University of Western Ontario, earning a Bachelor of Education Degree and winning a gold and a silver medal for Highest Achievement in Practice Teaching and overall academic standing, respectively.Mary's excellence in education continued when she started teaching. Over the course of her career, she inspired students at Centennial Public School (Waterloo), Sprucedale Public School (Shakespeare), King Lear Public School (Stratford), Upper Thames Elementary School and Michell District High School (Mitchell). She always cared deeply for her students and every day, strived to ensure they were prepared not only for high school, but also for life. In the classroom, she engaged her students through her creative and inspiring lessons, contagious enthusiasm and goofy sense of humour. Mary lived by her intrinsic belief that "it's what's inside that counts." She treated everyone with respect, fairness and kindness. She saw the best in people and helped them see the best in themselves. In her heart, Mary knew happiness meant being who you truly are, not what people think you should be.Mary's influence on her students extended beyond the classroom. She enhanced their school experience by leading countless extra-curricular activities, such as choreographing operettas, coaching cross-country, organizing the annual Terry Fox Run, and spearheading graduation trips and ceremonies. She was committed to her community, holding a myriad of volunteer positions across multiple organizations such as the Festival City Cooperative Nursery School, Stratford Kinsmen Y Aquatic Club (SKYAC), the Canadian Cancer Society, the United Way and Children's Aid Society. A lover and patron of the arts, Mary was a member of the Stratford Festival Playwright's Circle and endeavored to see every single play - and forum chat - every year.But where Mary shone brightest was as a mother, wife, grandmother and friend. She lived to make her family feel loved and supported, taking joy in the happiness of her two daughters, Jane and Julia. Mary encouraged her daughters to chase their dreams, no matter how ambitious, and was always there to celebrate the victories or pick up the pieces left by a loss. No call was ever too late and no journey was ever too long, even a 10-hour drive to Quebec City or flight to Texas to make a much-appreciated Thanksgiving Dinner for a house full of university students. For her husband Mark, she maintained what she called her "stars and rockets" of true love until the very end. She will be missed, but never forgotten, by her husband Mark, daughters Jane Wilkinson (Frank) and Julia Wilkinson (James), granddaughter Elise Etwell, parents George and Barbara Gall, sisters Elizabeth Hart (George) and Janet Thorpe (Don), mother-in-law Vallie Wilkinson, brothers-in-law Christopher Wilkinson (Maureen), David Wilkinson and Jeffrey Wilkinson, as well as her many nephews, extended family, friends, and those with whom she lived one day at a time. Mary was predeceased by her father-in-law John Wilkinson and nephew Adam Wilkinson.Although Mary is no longer with us, she is not gone. Together, we can make the world a better place by channeling our "Inner Mary": being there and doing the things that others need when they need it most.Despite the challenges of the pandemic, Mary's many friends, neighbours and supporters always found creative ways to lift her spirits during the last year of her life. Their kind words, thoughtful gifts, and comforting meals always made her feel surrounded by love and light. Mary was incredibly grateful for the skilled, hardworking, and most of all kind nurses, doctors and healthcare workers at the Stratford General Hospital Chemotherapy Unit, the London Regional Health Sciences Centre, Victoria Hospital, and the Bayshore Clinic in London.Mary's favourite place was outside in nature: she especially loved planting and caring for her trees and watching the sunsets over Lake Huron. As per her wishes, Mary's ashes will be sprinkled by immediate family at the cottage, where she can forever see the sparkles on the water. Given how many lives she touched and shaped, a Celebration of Mary's Life will be held once it is safe to do so.

She went on to become a well-qualified grade school teacher both in Windsor and in Toronto after her 1949 Windsor wedding to her law school student, Richard Rohmer who was called to the Bar in Toronto in 1951 where he practiced Ontario-wide law until his retirement from the law at the end of 2019.Mary-O's special interest was the Royal Ontario Museum where she held many volunteer executive positions: focused on ancient Egypt and the organizing of great travel trips the most remarkable being throughout Russia back in the late days of communist rule. She has maintained the ROM interest and involvement to this time.Above all Mary-O has been a full participant, a true partner in the many activities and involvements of Richard in the law (CN Tower, Ontario Science Centre, GO Transit creation, the beginning of North York General Hospital, etc.) in the Canadian military, in the creation of many fiction and non-fiction books etc., and his active involvement as Honorary Head of many organizations including a thirteen-year term as Chancellor of the University of Windsor and skiing at the Craigleith Ski Club.Mary-O will be missed by all who knew her whether in Toronto (including Don Mills where she and Richard were original dwellers for many years starting in 1953/54) or Collingwood.A memorial service for Mary-O will be held this coming Saturday January 11, 2020 at 2:30 p.m. at All Saints Anglican Church, 32 Elgin Street, Collingwood.Memorial donations in Mary-O's honour to Hospice Georgian Triangle -Campbell House, 240 Erie St. Collingwood, or a charity of one's choice would be appreciated.Condolences can be sent directly to the family at generalrohmer@rogers.comArrangements entrusted to Fawcett Funeral Homes - Collingwood Chapel.	at All Saints Anglican Church, 32 Elgin Street, Collingwood.Memorial donations in Mary-O's honour to Hospice Georgian Triangle -Campbell House, 240 Erie St; Collingwood, or a charity of one's choice would be appreciated.Condolences can be sent directly to the family at generalrohmer@rogers.comArrangements entrusted to Fawcett Funeral Homes - Collingwood Chapel.	t	NULL	NULL	43.6532	-79.3832

This is particularly true when you find out you have a glioblastoma-an incurable brain cancer. Two and a half years ago when I was almost 69, I got the news about my tumour after experiencing only a couple of weeks of mild symptoms. Up until the afternoon of my diagnosis, I lead a busy, productive life running a business I started more than two decades earlier. My wife and I travelled extensively, we ate well and exercised several times a week. In fact I was in excellent health for my entire life having been fortunate enough to dodge the many bullets that can cut a man down in his prime or destroy his quality of life. Still, here I am now, done with treatments and surgeries, facing the end of my life. Most people are satisfied waiting for others to write about them after they're gone, but leaving things to others has never really been my style. And it hardly makes sense to change that now.I was born April 28, 1943 in Thorold, Ontario. From my modest beginnings as a young lad growing up on Patricia Street with my sisters Geraldine and Patsy and my brother Chris, I worked hard to make a better life for myself. As a teenager, I was eager to help out in our many family businesses, from dry cleaning to television repair to dairy delivery.Although many people would call the experiences of my youth "character building", none of them prepared me fully for the next chapter of my life. After high school, my family had no money for costly university tuition, so in 1961 I did the only thing I could do to secure myself the future I wanted: I enrolled at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston where I could trade three years of military service for an education. As an engineering student, the academic load was rigorous, but it was the mandatory participation in athletics that really took a toll-though mostly on my ego. Despite all the challenges of RMC, I emerged four years later a better man, with a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering. I've always credited RMC with teaching me the lessons I would need to continue down the road to a successful life. That's why I was so delighted to be able to create an endowment at RMC that funds both the Captain John Bart Teamwork Prize and the Captain John Bart Leadership Award for new recruits each year.After my service in the military, I returned to school and earned an MBA and PhD in Finance from the University of Western Ontario. I went on to teach corporate finance and stock marketing investing at several Canadian universities. It was during my tenure at the University of Windsor that I discovered the Stock Selection GuideTM developed by the late George Nicholson Jr. of the Detroit-based National Association of Investment Clubs (NAIC). I updated the Guide and began introducing it to Canada's individual investors. Subsequently, I developed the Canadian Shareowner Association in 1987 which came to include various investing educational publications, seminars and events. Now known as Canadian ShareOwner Investments Inc., this unique organization became the only Canadian investment dealer to sponsor a real-money stock market competition for university and college students ("Doublescoop"). Today, ShareOwner continues to provide Canada's only dollar-based stock trading service to individual investors.I feel very happy that my investment education and stock brokerage business have touched the lives of thousands of Canadians. Hopefully, they will all continue to follow the sensible investment principles taught by Canadian ShareOwner such as dollar-cost- averaging, investing over the long-term, and limiting portfolios to a few high quality growth stocks and low cost exchange-traded funds that track indices such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.Despite the cancer that is ravaging my brain, I really do believe I have been one of the lucky ones. I have truly enjoyed a rich life. Not only am I thankful for the many opportunities I have had to help improve the lives of others, but also for the strong, loving relationships I have built with my wife, Mary, my children, Angela Bart, Sarah Rogers and David Bart as well as with my grandchildren Ellie Bart Bailey, Evelyn Bailey, Emma Rogers, Max Rogers, Zac Rogers, Bobby Bart, Johnny Bart and Annie Bart. I am also grateful for Dr. Mark Bernstein's neurosurgery team and the doctors and nurses at the Gerry and Nancy Pencer Brain Tumor Centre at Princess Margaret Hospital for helping extend my life for considerably longer than might have been expected.Mary has stood by me since my tumor was first diagnosed and has helped me live comfortably with the side effects of the surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. I don't know what I would have done without her. Even when the treatments and the disease itself left me weary and battered, Mary would insist that we get up and do things-even simple errands-just to get out of the house. It is thanks to Mary's spunk and determination that we were even able to spend a good part of the last two winters out of the cold in a beautiful condo in Florida. And right up until the end, she would always insist that we honour our weekly "date night" on Friday evenings where we would drink wine, eat cheese and dance or just listen to a selection of special music we compiled together. It seems fitting then, that I should leave her with the lyrics of one of our all-time favourite songs by Alan Jackson: "We won't be sad. We'll be glad for all the life we've had." And I am very glad for all the life I've had.Cremation has taken place. Family and close friends will gather at a future date for a celebration of John's life. In lieu of flowers, donations to the Gerry and Nancy Pencer Brain Centre at Princess Margaret Hospital would be appreciated.

He faced this terrible disease with courage and dignity to the very last day. Eduardo emigrated with his family from Miranda-do-Douro, Portugal as a young boy in the 1950s and the family put down new roots in Toronto. His hometown and homeland remained close to his heart throughout his life. He attended Harbord C. I., Glendon College (York University) and the University of Windsor, graduating with a law degree in 1976 and thus becoming one of the first Portuguese-Canadian lawyers in the community. After being called to the bar, he established a most successful law practice in west Toronto. On account of his knowledgeability, competence, hard work, common sense and sound advice, he quickly developed the reputation of being one of the best in his field. He was a man of honesty, integrity and action who had tremendous vision and the tenacity to see his dreams to fruition. He loved nature and culture. He lived in Beeton and at Grippen Lake in order to be closer to nature. He spent countless hours outdoors on weekends and in the evenings, planting vegetable gardens and trees, chopping wood, landscaping and planning his next projects. He promoted Portuguese culture in Toronto by co-founding the Clube Transmontano in the late 1970s, and later by supporting many local "fado" singers with his annual New Year's Party that showcased their talents. His passion for the national song of Portugal became legendary within the community over time. These are just a few of the qualities that endeared him to those who knew him. He leaves behind his loving wife Ana, his eldest daughter Danielle, his son-in- law Justin, his grandson Adlen of whom he was so very proud, his middle son Benjamin, also a lawyer, his daughter-in-law Jennifer, his youngest daughter Sarah and her partner Étienne. He was also the beloved and much- admired brother of Mary and the proud uncle of Roger, Cristina, David, Raquel and Amanda.

So the party was brought to him. He was in hospital in Toronto hoping for a second liver transplant when he died on October 8, 2017, surrounded by people who love him. Aubrey began experiencing the symptoms of liver disease in his second year of medical school. In May 1998, he received the gift of life: a liver transplant. For the next nineteen (19) years, Aubrey lived life to the fullest. He travelled the world with his wife, Caroline Vanneste. He participated in many Canadian and World Transplant Games, winning medals in running, squash, golf, tennis, and cycling. He also embraced the winter sports of cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and skating on the Rideau Canal. Born and raised in Windsor, Aubrey had a family medical practice in Windsor and was an emergency room physician at Grace Hospital. In 1992, he moved to Ottawa where he met and married Caroline. He worked as a chronic care physician at Bruyère Continuing Care, and as a medical reviewer of clinical trial applications for Health Canada. Aubrey was a graduate of the University of Windsor (B.Sc., M.Sc.) and the School of Medicine at McMaster University (MD). His volunteer work included serving as President of the Canadian Transplant Association, and as a member of the board of PSC Partners Seeking a Cure, an organization dedicated to providing education and support to PSC patients, families and caregivers and to raising funds to research causes, treatments and cures for this rare disease. Aubrey was a thoughtful, caring man who was devoted to his wife, his patients, and family and friends near and far. His loved ones and the transplant and PSC communities miss him dearly. Aubrey is survived by his wife, Caroline; his mother, Esther (Maurice A.H.);  his siblings William [Pamela, Joshua, Benjamin (Rebecca), Miriam (Nathanial, Savannah, Xavier];  Ruth;  Judith (Robert, Daniel, Nathan);  numerous cousins, Vanneste family members, and his "pretend daughter" Megan.

Born on May 31, 1941 in Kirkland Lake, Glen was an exceptional hockey player whom, at the tender age of 16, was drafted to the Detroit Red Wings. He would not be able to go to the NHL due to exposure to tuberculosis.  Glen remained in Kirkland Lake until he left to study engineering at Windsor University. He worked many years managing structural engineering projects. His expertise and management successes can be witnessed across the country. Residing in Vancouver, he  was accountable for the successful installation of the Grouse Mountain tramway, a project he was rightfully proud of. The iconic 'Red Skyride' remains one of the top 10 attractions to see in the Vancouver area today.  He also had an entrepreneurial side, having owned and operated a deli for many years in Kelowna's famous Orchard Park Mall.  After several years west, Glen decided to return to the Toronto area and once again hone his talent for managing large multi-million-dollar projects. He worked his final years at Loblaws where he built many 'Great Canadian Superstores' ending his career with the construction of Loblaws new headquarters in Mississauga.  In 1986, Glen returned to Kirkland Lake for a visit, where he reconnected with the girl who, in his words, 'he used to watch disappear behind the firehall'. Glen and Mignonne (who he affectionately called 'Baby') enjoyed 31 years of respect and love for one another. With this relationship, he gained an extended family, for which, he valued as dearly as his own.  Glen was a generous soul. At a young age, he paid for his sisters' nursing school to ensure she had a good career. Throughout his lifetime, he always gave of himself, never asking or expecting anything in return. He, on many occasions, paid for his assistants' flight home to visit her family at Christmas time.  He had a knack for building friendships and he loved and respected them all. Always the center of attention, he had an innate ability to tell a story. Glen enjoyed many outings to meet up with his large network of friends on a regular basis.  During the years, Glen fell through the cracks of our broken health care system. Despite so, he always found a way to move forward and see the brighter side. Once it was clear that the things he valued most would no longer be readily available to him, he made the brave decision to end treatment. He passed peacefully, with dignity and on his own terms. Those that know Glen's character, wouldn't be surprised at his courage.  While Glen is no longer at our 'kitchen table', there is no doubt, he is already reconnecting with old friends and family and building new relationships on the other side. It's easy to envision him telling stories like no other while he waits for his 'Baby' (Mignonne) to join him.  RIP Glen. Thank you for everything! It's easy sailing now, until we meet you over the rainbow!  Glen was predeceased by his parents, Barbara (MacPherson) and Donald Cameron. He is survived by his spouse, Mignonne, his treasured son, Marc (Sheila), his stepchildren Steven (Cheryl), Tracy (Dean) as well as his grandchildren, Jordan, Derek, Jenna, Steven, Patricia, Lauren and Julia...all of whom, he couldn't wait to brag about.  Glen is also survived by his siblings, Doreen (Bernie, deceased), Colin (Carole), Mary (Ron, deceased) and Warren (Linda), as well as many nephews and nieces, all of whom he cared deeply for.  In respect to Glen's final wishes, there will be no visitation. Cremation has taken place. A memorial will be planned for a later date where we hope to see many of Glen's KL and 'mall' companions come prepared to share their special memories of a 'great man'.  In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to MacKenzie Health Foundation (Dialysis or Palliative Care Wing) or to the Southlake Hospital Foundation (Stronach Cancer Center) whose intervention and personalized care of Mignonne gave Glen many 'extra' years with his 'baby'.  Glen's family wishes to extend a sincere thank you to Dr. Beausoleil and the palliative care team at MacKenzie Health, who in his final days, ensured he received the care he so deserved. We would also like to thank Margaret, Glen's dialysis nurse, in whom he had full trust and respect for.  For online version of this notice, please visit Roadhouse and Rose funeral home.

Marie wish to announce that Sister Alma Thorne transitioned peacefully into the heart of God on June 12, 2024.  Sister Alma was born in Toronto, ON to Martha Alice (Tedd) and Charles Thorne (both deceased), the youngest of four children.  She is predeceased by her siblings: Charles Thorne; Marjorie (Wilf, also deceased) Cartier; and Eileen (Don, also deceased) Sanderson. She is survived by her sister-in-law, Bernice Thorne, and nieces and nephews: Helen Sundquist, Rev. Richard Thorne, Patricia Mink, Barb Bachmeier, and David Sanderson. Alma entered the Congregation of The Sisters of St. Joseph of Sault Ste. Marie on September 30, 1958, from Christ the King Parish, Sudbury. Prior to entering she was a staff nurse/instructor at Wellesley Hospital Toronto and at Sudbury General Hospital. Following her novitiate, she was assigned to the faculty of St. Joseph's Hospital School of Nursing, North Bay.  The congregation then supported further studies: in 1967, Alma completed her Bachelor's of Science in Nursing at the University of Windsor and in the mid 1970's, she received her Masters of Science from the University of British Columbia. From 1969-1988 Alma was a much sought after and respected clinical instructor at Marymount School of Nursing, Sudbury General Hospital, the Sudbury Regional School of Nursing, and at Canadore College North Bay, where she later specialized in geriatric nursing.  She was a highly skilled, humble and compassionate nurse.  Her sparkling wit smoothed over any stressful situation. From 1988 – 1992, Alma served as the Occupational Health Nurse at St. Joseph's Hospital, Thunder Bay.  She then returned to St. Joseph's Motherhouse and served as Director of Life Planning until 1995. While Alma retired in 2006 she continued to live, participate, and celebrate life to the full, including being a chauffeur until 2008, to assist sisters who no longer were able to drive.  As a loyal Torontonian, she was an ardent Blue Jays and Raptors fan. Alma appreciated times of solitude and was often seen in the library and yet remained involved in various activities in the community. For her, challenges were not obstacles but stepping stones. In her words "Life is a journey; mine has been rich and has been blessed with increased abundance and tremendous lessons in living.  Being a Sister of St. Joseph taught me that all life itself is a celebration of God's goodness and the true meaning of charity is love in all its dimensions." Sister Alma will be received at St. Joseph's Motherhouse at 2:00 p.m. on Friday, June 21, 2024 with a Prayer Vigil at 4:00 p.m.  Mass of the Resurrection will be celebrated at St. Joseph's Motherhouse, Sacred Heart Chapel on Saturday, June 22, 2024 beginning with closing prayers at 3:50 p.m. followed by Liturgy at 4:00 p.m. Expressions of sympathy or donations to the works of the Congregation in memory of Sister Alma may be made athttps://csjssm.ca/contact-usOnline condolences can be made atwww.hillsidefuneral.caSister Alma rest in peace.

Predeceased by his parents Joseph H. Evans and Genevieve McManus, his sister and brother-in-law Elizabeth and Thomas Holmes, and his nephew Michael Holmes.  He is survived by his two children Joseph H.C. Evans and Cynthia Roy (John), his three grandchildren, Geniveve Evans, Taylor Evans and Lina Roy, his sister Mary Catherine Summers (Craig) their children Clayton (Joni) and family and Erin Boring (Nicolas), his brother Tom Evans (Judy), Kym, Nicholas and Hannah and his nephew Tom Holmes (Rachelle), his first wife and the mother of his children, Beverley Evans (nee Keyes), his former wife Paulette Evans (formerly Richard nee Theriault), her children Lyne Kelly (Chris), Nathalie Cormack (Jeff), and her grandchildren Michelle, Stephanie, Garbrielle and Kyra Kelly and Abigayle Cormack.  Born in Cadillac (Rouyn-Noranda), Quebec, Joseph attended high school at St. Michael's College in Toronto, graduating from the University of Windsor in 1964 with a B.A.Sc. in Civil Engineering. Through high school and into university, summers were spent working at the mine back home, first for Barnat Mines Ltd., later East Malartic Mines Ltd.  In 1966 he moved to Red Deer, Alberta where he married Beverley and where his son Joe Jr. was born.  From there he moved his young family to the outskirts of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, where his daughter was born.  In 1973 he family moved to Stratford, ON where he worked for Gaffney Construction as office supervisor and manager. Stratford always remained dear to his heart as did the friends and colleagues he made there.  In 1979, Joe moved his family to North Bay, returning to his roots in mining, working for JS Redpath Limited as Senior Manager of Civil Engineering. He started his own mine engineering firm, Shelta Engineering Inc., in the early 1990s providing engineering, design and project management services to a long list of Canadian and international clients. Shutting down operations in 1999, Joseph continued to work as a consulting engineer and project manager until the age of 75.  Joe was proud of his family's history in the mining industry and indeed it was, and is, a family legacy. His grandfather Joseph J Evans had amongst various other occupations worked as the manager of the Cobalt foundry in the early 1900s. His grandfather TJ McManus had funded many mining exploration ventures.  His father Joseph H. Evans, a mine engineer, was a graduate of Queen's University, and was Chief Engineer overseeing three properties, including Barnat and East Malartic.  His son Joe Jr. is a shaft supervisor with Cementation, and his grandson Taylor is now working as a miner.  Joe was a remarkable man, proud of his ability to read people and able to recognize the skills and underlying potential in those he met; something he made great use of as a life-long project manager, able to bring together the individuals and skills that were needed to get each task done.  His family will remember him best for his love of blacksmithing, wood working, as a student of history, an amateur geologist, an avid woodlot owner, for his love of his Irish ancestry and his unique sense of humour which he passed to all three of his grandchildren. Joe kept daily notes marking events, the weather and his interactions with people.  Although his children would say he was the consummate procrastinator, it was more correct to say that he was a methodical planner. He painstakingly researched each new area of interest, each project, each new venture, constantly drafting designs, taking measurements and planning.  As such, he could always be counted on for thoughtful, measured council.  He was a resilient soul, coming to terms with personal demons, overcoming an earlier bout with cancer and making peace with himself and his place in the world.    Joseph was exceedingly proud of his children and grandchildren and was happiest when they gathered at his much loved 100 acre woodlot in Chisholm, ON.    As per his express wishes, there will be no funeral service. Joe will be interred early next summer at Boxwell Cemetery, Powassan where appropriately, you can just see his beloved woodlot in the distance.

We have lost a woman of many loves and deep integrity who sought and achieved a purposeful life. A teacher, student, feminist, social justice advocate and practitioner, and delightful and funny friend, Joan was an inspiration and mentor to many. She had a genius for friendship - both human and animal - and maintained active connections to all those she met along her way. Always well informed, Joan was often reduced to tears in the face of everyday injustices but was never angry or despairing. A deeply spiritual woman, her love of music and poetry helped balance her willingness to learn about and engage with our troubled world.Joan Eileen Tinkess was born on December 16, 1933 in Ottawa, Ontario, the loving daughter and second of six children of Eileen (née Mooney) and William Tinkess. At a young age, Joan determined that she would join the Grey Sisters of the Immaculate Conception in Pembroke, Ontario with the purpose of serving in the Dominican Republic (DR). She joined the congregation straight out of high school, taught elementary school in Ottawa, made her final vows in 1956, and left for the DR in 1958.Joan said she felt fully alive and purposeful in the Dominican Republic.  Having struggled with French, she learned Spanish in a flash and quickly bonded with her students in Yamasà where she taught elementary school, was later chosen to be the first principal, and for the first year was the only teacher in the high school. The arrival of Mary Tiner, with whom Joan would share a life-long common path, set a new course. Together, they studied, attended workshops, and took to heart the teachings of Vatican II, which they recognized had the potential to revolutionize the relationship between the Catholic Church and Third World Countries (a new term at that time). Joan and Mary formulated the idea of connecting with communities in new ways. They would live among the people in local housing, travel by motorcycle as the local people did, and help local women fulfill their desires for better lives - that is, put the ideals of Vatican II into practice. In those early post-Vatican II days, their lofty goal of responding to the call to serve the poor by living simply, as the people lived, led them, in 1970, to leave their religious community.Always self-aware and with clarity of purpose, Joan and Mary, made their way back to the DR in 1971, on their own terms, this time to Cutupú, a small rural community where they taught in local schools. Here, Joan's abiding belief in women and collective empowerment was realized. In consultation with local women, Joan and Mary led workshops that encouraged the women to speak out about their daily challenges, organize and participate in meetings, and take up leadership positions in their associations. The practical outcome of these efforts was the formation of the Federaçion Campesina Juana y Maria, a federation of over 800 women in 30 member associations. In time, the women learned how to manage a plan of self-funded micro loans, which they faithfully repaid month by month. These small amounts of money, which were carefully superintended by women chosen by the group, enabled women to pay for their children's education and purchase items that made their lives, and the lives of their families, more productive and more comfortable. The details of these ten years are recounted by Joan in her memoir, No Turning Back, which she self-published with the help of many friends in 2016.Joan returned to Canada in 1980 where she completed her undergraduate degree in religious studies at the University of Windsor, then taught world religions and social justice courses at Assumption High School until her retirement in 1994. In Windsor, she engaged in a wide range of women- and animal-centred activities including Gaia Singers, Women in Black, retired teacher lunches, social justice book clubs, and animal care and protection. Her other passions included the Windsor Symphony Orchestra, wood carving, and a commitment to Unitarian Universalist teachings.In July of this year, Joan and Mary returned to the Dominican Republic one last time where they both received presidential medals of honour from the president of the republic for their decades of work. Afterwards, away from the capital city, Joan and Mary were celebrated by the hundreds of women and children (now adults with their own children and grandchildren) whose lives have been improved by the initiatives they nurtured in the 1970s - initiatives that are going strong today. Indeed, the importance of the ground-up, women- and community-led model of social and economic development to which Joan and Mary were committed is now widely recognized as the essential first step for long-lasting community change.  However, it was another twenty years before the world officially learned - from male economists - of the development potential of micro lending.At the end of her life, Joan spent four weeks in The Hospice of Windsor and Essex County on Empress Street, where the atmosphere of peace and loving care sustained her reflective state of mind. During this time, she welcomed many visitors from near and far, in person and by telephone, whom she had met in pursuit of her many passions. Joan remained mindful and focused until the end. She held hands and reminisced with her visitors, recounted their shared commitments and activities, often adding details of mutual experiences her visitors had forgotten. Joan was comforted by visitors who read favourite poems and short stories, listened to music with her and sang beloved songs. Joan described this journey as making her soul.One of Joan's last requests was Simon and Garfunkel's Sound of Silence, which warns of the emptiness that ensues when we fail to speak and do not listen to each other. Joan reminds us all to reject fear and always speak up against injustice.Joan is survived by Mary Tiner, her sister Sylvia Wolff, brother Brian, sister-in-law Arlie Tinkess, goddaughter Melissa, members of her extended family, and her many grieving friends and former students.Cremation has taken place.  Visitation will be held at Anderson Funeral Home, 895 Ouellette Avenue, Windsor (519-254-3223) on Saturday, October 28, 2023 from 12:00 noon, followed by a Celebration of Joan's life at 1 p.m.In lieu of flowers, please consider donations to Wings Wildlife and Rehabilitation Centre, The Humane Society of Windsor and Essex County, The Hospice of Windsor and Essex County, or The Welcome Centre for Women and Families.Arrangements entrusted to Families First, 3260 Dougall Avenue (519-969-5841).

Along with his enjoyment of travel to many parts of the world, he played squash and football with his best friend Jim.

Now he has finally caught up with the loved ones who have gone before him, most especially his beloved wife Denise.Murray was a thoughtful and intelligent man, of joyful spirit and deep faith. Despite remarkable achievements, he retained an essential humility throughout his life. Born in the mining town of South Porcupine, Ontario, he loved hockey and excelled early as a player. When he turned 16, he received offers from all six NHL teams. After finishing high school while playing at St. Michael's in Toronto, he joined the Chicago Black Hawks, and during the 1950s he went on to play for the Boston Bruins and Detroit Red Wings. He was always aware that he had achieved the Canadian dream.But he had other dreams. In 1958 he left professional hockey to attend the Assumption University of Windsor, where he earned a B.A. and met the love of his life, Denise Lancop. They married in 1960 and together had six children, a loud, boisterous, but loving and supportive brood who sustained him to the end of his life. He was our family's anchor, our warm, gracious, good-humoured, loving Dad, who instilled in us a relentlessly positive spirit and a commitment to always be there for each other.Murray built a career in hockey administration, beginning with the Seattle Totems of the Western Hockey League. Certain of the emerging importance of the law in sport, he returned the family to Canada in 1974 so he could enter law school at the University of Ottawa. After his call to the bar, he was hired as the first full-time president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, which later became Hockey Canada. Murray was a passionate advocate for minor hockey and recreational play. During his presidency, he established the Program of Excellence for the men's National Junior team, which he felt brought the best of the game to the world. He was very proud to introduce the women's program and its national team, and in 1990 to bring the inaugural Women's World Championship to Ottawa. His goal was always to share the joy of the game with as many as possible. For years he represented Canada at the International Ice Hockey Federation, where he worked to nourish the growing enthusiasm for the game around the world. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a Builder in 2005 and made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2013.For all his accomplishments, Murray was most proud of his beautiful wife and large family. Heartbroken after Denise's death in 2022, he carried on bravely until his big heart eventually failed. He leaves the 'original six' and their families: Michelle (Tom Stevenson), Dan (Nathalie Zaquine), Jennifer (Chris Hurley), Jim, Elizabeth (Mark MacAulay), and Mary (Rodney Bylsma), grandchildren Matt (Samantha Baker) and Jimmy Stevenson, Clara and Mariane Costello, Emily and Kate Bylsma, and Maya MacAulay-McCabe, as well as Sally and Megan Enright and family. Predeceased by brothers Don and Father Les Costello, he leaves his dear brother Jack (Uta) and sister Rita Hogan, all their children and families, and a wide circle of extended family, friends and former colleagues.Friends may call at the Whelan Funeral Home, 515 Cooper Street, Ottawa, on Monday, August 19, 2024 from 3 - 5 p.m. and 7 - 9 p.m. A funeral mass will be held at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, August 20, 2024 at St Patrick's Fallowfield Roman Catholic Church, 15 Steeple Hill Crescent, Nepean.

He was born in London, Ontario in 1942 to Harvey and Ivy Ward. He grew up in Strathroy and Windsor, Ontario. Despite a false start at the U of T, where love of bridge trumped studying, he spent many happy years pursuing higher education at various universities, including Mount Allison, the University of Windsor (twice!) and the University of Michigan. But for the need to support a family, he would no doubt have remained a professional student. He became a librarian and then a lawyer and loved both professions. He defined himself as a Crown prosecutor and never missed the chance to trot out a Latin maxim (usually to annoy his children). He was a mentor to many young lawyers and took great pride in their achievements. He is survived by his wife, his children and his grandchildren, of whom he was very proud.

After a lengthy battle with congestive heart disease, he died peacefully at home. In 2010, he suffered a major heart attack and had no pulse for 16 minutes. Thanks to the quick response of the Ottawa Paramedics and to many of the doctors and staff at the Queensway-Carleton Hospital and the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, he survived and not only continued his research for 5 additional years, he provided his family with many happy memories for almost eight more years. Bob is survived by his wife Carole Brook (Andruski) and his daughters Patricia Louise and Cara Joan (Daniel Holloway) and a number of cousins. He was predeceased by his daughter Melissa Jane and his parents Stella and Michael Stelmack. Bob was a wonderful husband and brought his wife flowers regularly. He respected her tremendously and always encouraged her to work towards her goals. He idolized his children, always supporting their endeavours and encouraging them in most of things they chose to do.  Born in Sudbury and raised in Windsor, Bob made many lasting friendships, some dating back to primary school and others dating from his teenage years. He loved the outdoors and for a number of years as a teenager he was a councillor at YMCA Camp Pine Crest in Muskoka Lakes. A very large photo of him hung in the YMCA in Sudbury for many years and still may be there. Bob enjoyed woodworking and referred to himself as an amateur carpenter. He built the family cottage by himself with a lot of assistance from his family and friends. He also installed the plumbing and built much of the furniture. The cottage was his favorite place in the entire world and he spent many summers, weekends and New Year's Eve celebrations there with family and friends. Bob was a gifted student and an aspiring athlete. Hockey and football were his favorite sports and he played them with great intensity. In his final year at Assumption High School in Windsor he was selected to the first Canada Dry all-star high school football team for Ontario and he also won the trophy as the most valuable lineman in the province. Although he was scouted and offered opportunities to play professional sports, he decided that he would pursue an academic career and began his studies in psychology at the University of Windsor. Upon completion of his Master's Degree he taught at St. Paul's College at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg for two years and then completed his doctorate in psychology at the University of Ottawa. In 1970, he began his lengthy teaching career, spanning 40 years, as a professor and adjunct professor at the UofO. Bob loved to teach and he was respected by many of his colleagues and former students. He treated everyone with respect and lauded their achievements and gave them the credit that was due to them all the time. After his family and friends, Bob's greatest love was research where he made significant contributions in the area of the psychology of personality and individual differences. Professor Byron Rourke, Director of Psychology at the University of Windsor said at a Canadian Psychological Association Meeting that "Robert Stelmack was the greatest research psychologist he had ever met." Bob greatly admired the work of Hans Eysenck who was an early leader in the study of personality and he spent two separate sabbaticals in London, England working and studying with Hans and others in the field. Dedicated to the study of intelligence and individual differences, Bob was one of the founding members of the International Society for the Study of Individual Differences (ISSID). Beginning in 1983, meetings were held every two years in various places around the world and Bob looked forward to all the meetings, presenting his research and students and interacting with so many colleagues. He was a dedicated president and member of executive for many years and maintained the archives. In November 2017, Bob's scientific contributions were recognized in Volume 118, a special issue of Personality and Individual Differences (PAID), the official journal of ISSID. Some copies of the Introduction will be available at Bob's celebration of life service. Additional copies of the Introduction and complete copies of the issue can be accessed at Personality and Individual Differenceswww.sciencedirect.com. In his memorial to Bob on the ISSID website, Dr. Philip Corr, President of ISSID said that "Bob's scientific contribution was matched by his generosity and support of many students and colleagues around the world. In a special issue of PAID, many of them fondly recounted this positive influence on their own development. Especially noteworthy was Bob's humility: he was never one to chase the limelight  his was a conscientious and sure-footed approach, leading to a solid body of lasting research. Bob's passing reminds us that the sophistication of psychological science today, including major advances in the field of individual differences, was made possible only by the pioneering work of those who may now be gone, but not forgotten." The Dr. Robert Michael Stelmack Memorial Research Award has been established at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, to fund research on the study of the psychological aspects of heart function prior to and during heart disease. This award is designed to honour Bob's work as a scientific researcher and to honour the doctors, nurses and other staff at the UofO Heart Institute for giving Bob the "gift of life" for almost eight additional years. A "Celebration of Life" and memorial service for Bob will be held in the Sacred Space at Beechwood, Funeral, Cemetery and Cremation Services, 280 Beechwood Avenue, Ottawa, on Friday, October 5, 2018 at 1:00 pm.

He leaves behind loving memories to be forever cherished by his wife Christine, children Matthew (Jennifer) and Christopher (Beth), granddaughters, Katherine and Sarah, sister Gayle Moore, niece Leah Mansfield (Tony), grandnieces, Clare and Jane, sister-in-law, Elizabeth Cinapri, and his friends. Terry was a graduate of the University of Windsor, in Physical and Health Education, and the University of Toronto, in Physical Therapy. He began the work he loved in Barrie, Ontario before joining The Sports Therapy Clinic team at Carleton University in 1986 as a physiotherapist and co-owner until his full retirement this spring. Terry lived for family and friends, peppering their lives with humour and grace. He approached his work with pride and skill, never allowed his health challenges to affect the way he chose to live, and never learned how to start a sentence with the word "I." He loved a great game of baseball and hockey, a dynamic political discussion, and any project that required him to say, "I'm going to the workshop now." From his cedar strip canoe, the "Zippy Pickle", to the crafting of countless furniture pieces and his famous bowls, he was a man who found beauty in the grain of the wood. Now wasn't that a wonderful life. Special thanks and gratitude are extended to Dr. B. Mijavec and Dr. C. Campbell. Memories will be shared Saturday, September 9 at Heritage Funeral Complex, 1250 Trim Road, Orleans, Ontario. Visitation from 2:00 to 5:00. Remembrance service at 3:00.

Best known as a specialist on the issues of the Middle East, Michael was posted three times to Israel (twice as ambassador), as ambassador to Egypt and ambassador to Jordan. In between these postings, he served as director of the Middle East Relations division and as director general for Central and Eastern Europe. Early in his career Michael was assigned to serve as special assistant to Robert Stanfield, former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, who had been sent on an extensive mission to the Middle East with instructions to report to then-prime minister Joe Clark on whether the government should carry out Mr. Clark's campaign promise to move Canada's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The report, penned by both men, concluded that in the interest of peace it would be best not to move the embassy at this time. Perhaps Michael's finest work came during his 12 years of retirement when he initiated and co-directed the Jerusalem Old City Initiative (JOCI) an attempt to resolve one of the thorniest issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – the future status of the one square kilometer of territory that is home to some of the holiest sites of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the sovereignty of which is claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. The report's first volume, on security, was published earlier this year by the University of Windsor, Michael's alma mater, that also conferred on Michael an honorary doctorate of laws. Michael leaves Linda, his wife of 49 years whom he described as "the mainstay of my life," daughter Caroline "the pride of my life," and granddaughter Clara "the joy of my life." He is to be interred in Ottawa's historic Beechwood Cemetery following a private family service.		t	NULL	NULL	45.4215	-75.6972

The youngest son of a gentle beekeeper and his devoted wife, he and his only brother Bill grew up in the forties and fifties along the Portage River in Western Ohio. As a child, he treasured the many opportunities and insights afforded him growing up in the company of an extended family which included a great aunt and uncle born the previous century.After receiving his B.A. and M.A. in Ohio, he completed doctoral work at the University of Windsor. Bob was Associate Professor of Psychology at Clarke University in Iowa for a number of years before returning to Ontario to complete his Post-Doctoral work. He joined the Rideau Regional Centre in Smiths Falls in 1973, and served as a Supervising Psychologist and Acting Chief Psychologist until 2008. Devoted to the best interests of his clients, he challenged both himself and others to constantly question the benefit to the residents of any given course of action. After retiring, he continued to work with behaviourally challenged and autistic clients, as consultant to Lanark Community Programs. He was a member of the Board of Directors of Ontario Association of Consultants, Counsellors, Psychometrists and Psychotherapists. As Vice-President of OACCPP, he developed policies and procedures which have been recognized by Board colleagues as his legacy to the association.Those who knew him best cherished the pleasure of his company. His sensitivity, gentleness, and calm, assuring manner touched many. Often his dry, subtle wit was an antidote to a challenging situation. Bob was a treasured husband: His patience, love and gentleness wore well through over four decades of joys, challenges, and crises alike. A much-loved father and close friend to his only daughter, he supported and encouraged her through many obstacles and ambitions. Time with his granddaughter gave him a sense of great peace and fulfilment unimaginable in his last decade. He enjoyed fine music, great literature, his tractors and a "drinkable Chianti", as his favourite author would say. His absence will create an incredible void for family and friends.Visitation will be held on Friday, November 8th from 2-4 PM and 6-8 PM at 246 McCrea Rd., outside Merrickville.

In every photo of the two of them he is gazing at her, rapt. Theirs was a storied love, perfect for a man who spent so much of his life dedicated to storytelling. Kevin was a rare human being – a towering but humble intellectual with a searing curiosity and a soaring sense of humour. His laugh was the stuff of legend. He was defined by integrity, and driven to make the lives of those around him richer, easier, and more joyous. He was a very best friend and gentle advisor to Hilary. He was a beloved brother and guide to Patrick, Terrance, and Mary. He cherished and respected the Edmonds – the family he felt so fortunate to join.Kevin was a superb journalist and a treasured editor. He was a loyal and generous friend and mentor. He was real fun. And he had style.For many years, Kevin brought the world to Canada, first as a Parliamentary and Foreign Correspondent with The Canadian Press, then as Managing Editor at Maclean's, before becoming the Founding Editor of the elite FP News Service in Ottawa. He spent two years as an Editor with Newsweek before returning to Toronto as Maclean's Editor-In-Chief. From 1982-93, he oversaw the establishment of bureaus in London, Washington, Moscow, New York, and across Canada. He helped transform Maclean's from a fortnightly publication into a must-read weekly news magazine, and he recruited a generation of journalists whose careers were launched inside its halls. Close friends and colleagues called him KD, and under his guidance Maclean's became the most widely read weekly magazine in the country. Still, he made the place feel like a family. Next, Kevin brought Bloomberg Business News to Canada, serving as its Canadian Bureau Chief and Editor, and expanding operations across the country. From there, he spent three electric years as the Editor at the C.D. Howe Institute.Kevin began his career as a reporter with the Windsor Star and retired as the Executive Director of Public Affairs at the University of Windsor.

It should be entered into with abandon or not at all." –Julia ChildAs well as cooking, add in music, community, and friendship, and this quote is a snapshot of Frank Edward Burke, gourmet, wine connoisseur, musician, musical director, friend, uncle, and human extraordinaire. Frank died suddenly on Monday March 14, 2016 while enjoying a single malt scotch. Frank was a loving honorary uncle and godfather to Elizabeth Monk and Alexander Smyth – not a see-at-Christmas uncle, but a deeply involved and positive presence in our lives. He had a gift for long-term friendships, having known Tony and Helen Smyth since university days at Windsor. Paul and Gail Gaffney, Drummond and Marlene Hudson, and Nancy Turner enjoyed his company for over 40 years, and Jon Houseman and Paul Coughlan were also long- term friends. In 2007, Frank embarked on a quest to find a woman he had known briefly in his early twenties. A friend of his had forwarded a short story this woman had written about the time they met, and he had never been able to bring himself to throw it away. Through diligent Internet and library research, and by placing calls across North America, he actually managed to track down Mary Pat McStravick in Fort Worth, Texas. A correspondence began anew, and then some visits, and then a love affair that made the last six years of his life his happiest ever.While his gift for friendship was legendary, and many such friendships were solidified around gourmet meals of his making, Frank also left his mark in the music and theatre worlds. He graduated from St. Michael's Choir School, studied Canadian History at the University of Windsor from 1960 to 1963, and did a Masters at Carleton University. He then did contracts at CBC, was a life member of the American Federation of Musicians, and was an active member of Orpheus Musical Theatre Society for over four decades, including being Musical Director for Gigi, Applause, and Kismet. In the 1980s, Frank and a team produced the Canada Day Show on the Hill for several years and also worked on two editions of "Sounds & Saddles" for the RCMP Band and the Musical Ride. For the Jewish Community Centre Theatreworks, as accompanist, Frank was an integral part of ten musical productions in the 1990s.It is hard to imagine the show going on without Frank in our lives, but go on it must, though he will be sorely missed by many. Donations to Orpheus Musical Theatre Society in his memory will be gladly accepted.A Going Away Party and Celebration of His Life is scheduled for Sunday June 26, 2016 from 7:00 – 10:00 p.m. at Orpheus Musical Theatre Society, 17 Fairmont Avenue, Ottawa, as his life will certainly be honoured in the spirit in which he honoured his friendships.Friends are also invited to attend a Graveside Service on Tuesday June 28, 2016 at 1 p.m. at Mount Hope Catholic Cemetery, 305 Erskine Avenue, Toronto.

May 7, 1963 - March 13, 2006 It is with great sorrow and sadness that we announce the passing of Arden. Born in Hong Kong, Arden and his family moved to North Vancouver in 1973, where he attended Handsworth Secondary School. He was one of the few Canadians who was selected to be a Page in the House of Commons while attending Carleton University for his Bachelor of Arts degree. Arden always considered it an honour and privilege to be a Page during a time of all night sittings in the House of Commons. He was a part of the repatriation of the Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and was often seen alongside Pierre Trudeau, Joe Clark, Brian Mulroney, Perrin Beatty and Jeanne Sauve. Arden thereafter attended the University of Windsor, Faculty of Law where he met Kimberley, her very first day of law school. True to his fun-loving nature, Arden was dressed for the semi-formal event in running shoes, gym socks, shorts, cumberbund and full tuxedo. Arden obtained his Bachelor of Law degree in 1987, however, before departing Windsor, he became engaged to Kimberley six days after their first date. Arden returned to his roots in British Columbia and set up his law practice in Ladner, British Columbia where he was joined shortly thereafter by Kimberley, marrying in 1989, and practicing law together until 2002 when Arden became ill. Always believing that it is important to give more to ones community than to take out, Arden was actively involved in a number of volunteer activities in his community, despite a full time law practice, such as being Director and Chair of Delta Youth Services and Crime Prevention Society, a founding member of the Kids for Success Camp for young boys at risk, a member of the Rotary Club of Ladner serving as Treasurer and President, a volunteer for the Delta Hospital Foundation, a volunteer guest instructor for the Peoples Law School and Continuing Legal Education and Board Member for the Kirkland House Foundation. His passion was offroading and he was a founding member of the Border to Border Expedition Society since 1998. He traveled to Mexico, across North America and to the Arctic Circle with his group of Land Rover buddies, seeing and appreciating the beauty of North America and the depth of friendships while on these annual treks. The dirtier the vehicle became, the more it got stuck in mud, the more it smelled and the more stickers that he placed on his vehicle, all were seen as proud badges of honour. Arden's proudest accomplishment and biggest passion in his life were forever his girls. With the arrival of Kelsey in 1992 and Morgan in 1996, Arden was always involved with his girls. Friends often said that even after 14 hour long days during his annual treks, as soon as he pulled in for the evening, the most urgent and pressing matter in his heart was that he had to call the girls. His girls were his life and his passion his entire life, and we are blessed that despite the years that they spent with their Dad were cut short too quickly, we know that his spirit, love for life, mischievous nature, and commitment to his community are all attributes that his daughters proudly possess. Arden is survived by his wife Kimberley, his daughters Kelsey (13) and Morgan (9); parents Christopher and Virginia and his brother Bernard of Vancouver; predeceased by his sister Carol; and survived by his inlaws in Toronto and family throughout the world. Prayer service will be held on Friday, March 31st, at 7:00 pm and Christian Burial Mass will be held on Saturday, April 1st, 2006 at 10:00 am, both at Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church, 3900 Arthur Drive, Delta, British Columbia. Interment will follow at Boundary Bay Cemetery. A reception will be held at Beach Grove Golf & Country Club, 5946 12th Avenue, Delta, British Columbia. Knowing his zest for offroading and never treading lightly, the family graciously declines flowers. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Delta Hospital Foundation, 5800 Mountainview Blvd., Delta, British Columbia, in honour of Arden, and shall be designated towards the construction of the new Chapel and Sacred Space at Delta Hospital. Arden believed that if you can imagine it, you can achieve it. If you can dream it, you can become it. Indeed you did it all Arden. We love you a whole bunch plus one.....forever.

Pat's loving relationship with Margaret Maxted, her partner of almost 20 years, both sustained her and brought great joy to her life. Pat is loved and remembered by her mother Patricia Wigle, her beloved children Gillian Logan (Fabien Welp-Barr) and ZoÃ« Horn (Michael Richardson), her delightful granddaughter Anneke Barr, stepsons Paul Maxted (Jodi Turner) and David Maxted (Robert Kehle), her sister Karen Wigle (Austin Jeffries), her brothers Robert Wigle (Barbara O'Neill) and Bill Wigle (Monica Wigle), and niece and nephew Kelly and Nicholas Wigle. Pat treasured her family and celebrated the love that they shared together. She was supported throughout her illness by friends in Ottawa and elsewhere, especially the faithful group in Ottawa known as The Mighty Currents. Pat was one of four children cherished by her mother Patricia Wigle and the late Frederick Colin Wigle. She was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and grew up in Amherstburg, Ontario. She graduated from the University of Windsor in 1970 with an M.A. in English Language and Literature. For almost 20 years, Pat was happily employed by the Canadian Wildlife Service, where she was a managing editor in charge of publishing wildlife research and producing, as one of her enduring legacies, the leaflets and television public service announcements that Canadians know as Hinterland Who's Who. For the nine years that she lived with cancer, Pat embraced life to the full, enjoying such delights as bird-watching in Florida, growing a garden of wonderful lilies, playing in the waves with Anneke, singing alto in the church choir, travelling to Paris and Tuscany, and even a camping road trip up the Dempster Highway from Dawson City, Yukon to Inuvik, NWT. Pat planted a garden of life everywhere she went and she walked daily amid its beauty. Pat's deepest commitment was to the fostering of loving community. A member of First United Church for 20 years, she offered strong, passionate, and committed leadership to help the congregation create webs of relationship that would nurture, sustain, heal, and transform. Her vision and her energy upheld the congregation through difficult transition times and kept it grounded in its roots of compassion and justice- seeking. In the last years of her life, Pat continued to create a community of love and strength. The circle that formed around her was not a support group - she didn't want that. Rather, it was a circle that sustained and cared for each other through life's challenges and joys. Pat, as you travel on into the light and peace that awaits you, we remember you with love and deepest thanks. You have touched so many of us with love. Your vision has changed us. In your persistent striving to make this world a better place, you have inspired us. The prayer that has sustained us all travels with you: Mighty currents of God's healing love flow through you now, making you whole and free.

Survived by his wife Helen, of 56 years, son Blair (Brenda), daughter Shawneen, grandchildren Dylan, Rachael, Connor and Kylan and sister Louise. Predeceased by his daughter Julie, and his siblings William, Johnny, Ed, Joseph, Bernice, and Theresa. Leo will be forever associated with Miller Paving and McAsphalt Industries. Leo's story is not widely known outside the road building industry as he was a very private man, and because he and his partner, the late John Carrick, did not believe in public ownership. The Miller and McAsphalt companies remain as they began, family-owned enterprises. Leo was a giant in the industry and he was among the first rank of the Canadian entrepreneurs of his generation. His beginnings were modest. The youngest of eight children of Archibald and Mary McArthur of Owen Sound, Leo at nine years old lost his father to a work accident. With the strong support of his mother, his siblings, and the church, he was educated at St. Michael's College in Toronto and the University of Windsor. He began his career as a management trainee with Imperial Oil, where he met his future partner, John Carrick. Like all entrepreneurs, he and John were soon convinced they could do it better, and in 1970 left promising careers at Imperial to bet what little they had and all they could borrow on their new business, McAsphalt industries. McAsphalt began on a shoestring as a supplier of asphalt cement to the road building industry in competition with Imperial and other major oil companies.  In 1976 Leo and John purchased Miller Paving Limited. Leo took on management of Miller, and with it a business new to both himself and his partner. Over the next forty years, Leo vastly increased Miller's size and reach. Miller and McAsphalt operate across Canada and out of Atlanta, Georgia in the south-eastern US. Leo's career was characterized by hard work, rock solid integrity, and above all a passionate commitment to all of Miller's employees. Nothing was more important to Leo than family, and his employees were indeed an integral part of the McArthur family. Community was a cardinal Leo McArthur value; he believed in sharing his success with the communities in which he carried on business. Among countless initiatives he supported, Leo would probably point first to the Julie McArthur Regional Recreation Centre in Owen Sound, a gift in memory of his daughter. Leo was equally proud of his long support of the York Regional Police. His many contributions include his roles as a founder and then as a consistent force behind the annual Police Appreciation Dinner, and as a major sponsor of the YRP Community Safety Village. He especially enjoyed attending Village events involving the programs for school children. Leo was deeply involved in the affairs of his industry and served as the President of the Ontario Road Builders' Association, and as a long time board member of the Canadian Construction Association, along with numerous other Board appointments. "Leo and John Carrick will be preparing for a tour of the celestial highway system. Their transportation will be a 1975 CJ5 Jeep Renegade, Levi Blue Jeans Special Edition. They will be fueled by crackers, peanut butter, Myers Dark Rum, Coke, and White Owl cigars. Improvements to that highway system will be forthcoming".

Joe was predeceased by his parents, Myles and Dorothy, as well as his sister, Anne-Marie. Joe is survived by and will forever be in the hearts of his wife, Susan Beck Horne and his three daughters, Isabel Beck Shaw, Lucille Jarvis Shaw and Beatrice Myles Shaw. He will be lovingly remembered by his siblings, brothers Hugo (Nancy) Shaw and Grant (Karen) Shaw, sisters Claire Shaw, Lucille (Perry) Shaw and Helen (Mark) Tremblay. He will also be missed by Sue's father Peter Horne, brother David Horne and sister Lesley (Matt) Horne. Uncle Joe was an entertaining favourite amongst his many nieces and nephews: Matt (Erin - Parker and Norah) Mike and Emily Shaw; Laura, Simon and Martha Cope; Kari and Anne-Marie Sakki; Josh, Jordan, Ben and Natalie Tremblay; and Jarvis and Charles Easingwood. His many cousins cover Canada and the US like pins on a map. Joe was the youngest of seven and his mother's personal Canadian centennial project, born in Sudbury Ontario in 1967. He left his home town almost twenty-five years ago but still read the Sudbury Star every week. What he learned in Sudbury, he took to his eventual home, Vancouver, and that included his love of skiing, canoeing, camping, hiking, biking and cooking. Friends like Tony Kusnierczyk started early and lasted a lifetime. Quick- witted, fun loving and generous, Joe was larger than life and his presence was known wherever he went. Acadia University is where he made his mark on the varsity football team and graduated with a commerce degree. In 1994, he obtained his LLB from the University of Windsor and his JD from the University of Detroit. He was called to the Ontario Bar in 1996 and the New York Bar and British Columbia Bar in 1997. He was a partner at Harris and Company LLP. It is not possible to think of Joe without thinking of the pride and love he had for his wife, Sue and his three daughters. Their activities and accomplishments filled his life and he filled theirs with his incredible devotion and his humour. He was deeply involved in all aspects of his daughters' lives: coaching the soccer team; taking on the role of President of the Cypress Ski Club; driving countless miles with a car full of girls for field hockey games, practices and a tour in Holland; and cheering his daughters on in every endeavour, whether it was sports, music, academics or more personal. They were the centre of his universe and he celebrated them for being themselves in each of their own unique ways. A Funeral Mass will be celebrated for Joe at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, March 10, 2018 at OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL HELP CATHOLIC CHURCH, 2465 Crown Street, Vancouver. Visitation will be held on Friday, March 9 at CELEBRATION HALL in Mountain View Cemetery, 5455 Fraser Street, Vancouver (please enter the cemetery at Fraser and 39th and follow the signs to the hall). Joe's family and his brothers and sisters will be there from 6:30 p.m. until 8:00 p.m. to greet relatives and friends. Memorials may be made L'Arche, Sudbury (www.larchesudbury.org). Better yet, take a spin on your bike, cook a feast for family and friends or ski down a snowy trail. Joe will be right there with you.

After schooling in England, John "did his bit for King and Country" by enlisting in the army. He spent a few years serving in Germany, where he gained a lifelong interest in military history and passion for the German language. After receiving exemplary commendations during his service, he returned to civilian life in England where he worked in a Chartered Accountants' office and on the London Stock Exchange.John emigrated to Canada in 1952. He settled in Windsor, Ontario, where he and first wife Sirkka raised a busy family of six children. He worked in both Canada and the United States in accounting and auditing, specializing in tax and hospital accounting and public practice. John earned an accounting certificate from the University of Windsor and subsequently taught upper year courses in the university's CGA night school. John was a member of the Ontario CGA Board of Governors, eventually becoming President and receiving a Fellowship award. During that time, he joined the Masonic Order where he became a Master. He later headed west to work and, eventually, retire in British Columbia.As a young man, John was active in and excelled at many sports, including boxing as a middleweight on cadet and army teams, long distance running, college and inter-regimental rugby, fencing, and judo. As an adult, he managed his sons' minor lacrosse teams and took great pride in watching his children and grandchildren in their own athletic pursuits and successes.John always enjoyed music and singing, and in retirement was recruited into a men's chorus. Education was important to John, and he encouraged his children and grandchildren to study hard and push themselves as far as they could in their studies. In retirement, he took German language and history courses through Simon Fraser University and Kwantlen Polytechnic University where, as someone who had firsthand experience with much of the historical and cultural materials discussed in his courses, he often offered a unique perspective to his much younger classmates (and instructors).John loved social activities, whether dinners with extended family, traveling with his children's sports teams, gatherings of friends and choir mates, or he and Loretta's outings to the casino.John was predeceased by his parents John and Lilian, sisters Violet and Doreen, and sons Justin and Jarrod. John is survived by first wife Sirkka, wife Joan "Loretta" Spooner, daughters Sandra (Graham) and Stephanie (Dan), daughter-in-law Joanne, sons Jason and Janin, and grandchildren Alexandra, Brandon, Garrett, Jeremy, Joshua, and Kelsey.John will be dearly missed by his family and friends.		t	NULL	NULL	53.92	-122.75

He managed the last stage of life with humility and strength, endearing himself to those around him.In his own words, Stephen "had a heck of a run." Appreciative, humble and a pragmatist, his life experiences gave him a trusted perspective. He was welcoming and generous in every sense of the word. He listened attentively and offered restrained practical advice, often adding a touch of humour.Stephen was better known to many as Steve, Steve-o, Dad, Grandpa and Bonka. He was a devoted husband and father, compassionate friend, stock market enthusiast and accomplished napper. He was an avid reader, sun-seeker, a prodigious back-of-the-envelope mathematician, great euchre partner, all-star dishwasher and terrible cook. He was equal parts patient and impatient, in a mostly charming way.Stephen's many professional accomplishments included president and CEO of Cdn Hotel Income Properties REIT, Orca Bay Sports & Entertainment, BC Gas (Fortis), Trans Mountain Pipelines and Union Gas. He served as chair of BC Hydro, Coast Appliances, Anthem Properties, Retrocom REIT; as director for Quadreal Property Group, Ballard Power, Slocan Forest Products, Timberwest Forest Corp, Trimin Capital, and others; and as alternate governor for the NHL and NBA. He shared his time with non-profits including as chair of the University of Windsor and the Canadian Gas Association, vice-chair of the BC Business Council, director of the BC Children's Hospital Foundation and the Vancouver Board of Trade, and advisory committee member for the Institute of Corporate Directors' BC Chapter and Bowen Island Municipal Council.His proudest accomplishments were as father and grandfather. Stephen adored his children and vice versa. He was their biggest fan and he loved them unconditionally. His encouragement and infinite support came in all forms. He considered himself beyond lucky to have - and deeply love - four incredible grandchildren. He was quick to say they were inspirations in his fight with illness, and he was a much-anticipated source of joy to each of them.Stephen leaves behind his wife of 45 years, Kathy; his son David (Merle) and grandchildren Lucy and Stanley; his daughter Kate (Dallyn) and grandchildren Foster and Monroe; his sisters Sheila (Mel) and Diana (Doug), nephew Todd (Rachel) and nieces Stacey (Mike), Kristina (Matt), Meaghan and Erin (Dante); and an incredible group of people for whom he cherished the role of friend, colleague, mentor, golf partner, and stand-in dad.Not in his nature to seek recognition, when asked how he wanted to be celebrated Stephen asked that we simply support one another and move forward together.

He graduated in law from the University of Western Ontario, and obtained a Masters degree in law from Harvard, followed by a short time teaching at the University of Windsor.Craig came to Vancouver in the early 1970s, putting his legal talent to work at the BC Workers' Compensation Board under its new chairman Terry Ison, who had been hired by the NDP government to transform the WCB. Craig played a major role developing ground breaking occupational health and safety regulations to put more onus on employers for workplace safety and safer working conditions. When the chairman was fired by the next government, Craig showed his principles by resigning from the Board to protest its new direction.Craig then went into private practice, specializing in workers' compensation cases and occupational health and safety. He became a go-to lawyer pursuing cases on behalf of injured workers who received a raw deal from authorities. Always willing to push boundaries to achieve justice, he took on a number of Judicial Reviews of WCB decisions that resulted in significant changes to compensation law, including a landmark case giving worker complainants the right to see their files for the first time.He attracted attention across the country when he fought, unsuccessfully, to have alcoholism recognized as an industrial disease. In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, he was among the first to challenge the safety of the Canadian Red Cross blood supply, on behalf of hemophiliac mill worker who died of AIDS.Craig was also an active participant in the progressive BC Law Union for many years. He fought for civil liberties and threw himself into many protests, notably Operation Solidarity.  Craig was many things to many people: brother, uncle, friend, grandfather, neighbor, patient, legal advocate, adversary, lover, parent, employer, collector  Many of those relationships and roles were nurtured and blossomed over the years, while others became complicated by forces from within.It's important at this time for everyone who knew and cared for him, to acknowledge and respect the many different faces of Craig. His role as a grandparent and official "Hockey Grandpa" to Jack for 13 years, as well as being the doting, eccentric uncle to his many nieces, nephews, and godchildren, represented the very best of him. This included his role as Santa, bearing gifts at annual friend holiday gatherings.Craig loved to travel and loved the city of Vancouver and its diversity. He was a loud voice for its communities and community engagement. He never lost his love of hockey and was a long-suffering fan of the Vancouver Canucks, but not of the team's current ownership.All of us who knew him through the course of his life are left with a deep sadness at the toll his mental illness took. After spending his professional career counseling and fighting for the rights of others, Craig struggled to advocate for himself and follow advice from those who cared for his well-being.The layers of loss endured by many of us are truly immeasurable; if anything is to be taken from this aspect of his life story, it should be that no one is immune to the ravages of mental illness.Craig offered a helping hand to many and took great pleasure in finding a light in everyone.?His generous spirit will be missed by family, friends, and the many community circles he touched.Donations in Craig's memory can be made to the Canadian Mental Health Association or Covenant House Vancouver.A celebration of his life will be held March 30, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., at the Croatian Cultural Centre, 3250 Commercial Drive in Vancouver, BC.

He had three siblings, older brother Victor, younger brother Gary and younger sister Marlene. David was a people person. He knew the entire town of Dauphin and loved playing hockey in his backyard rink, riding his bicycle all over town with his brothers, playing the baritone horn in the Dauphin Boys & Girls Band and hanging out in his father's restaurant, The Grange Café. He would keep a daily tally on the pies, as he would like to indulge without permission at the disdain of the chefs. He was reprimanded from time to time by his father, but if you have ever met David, you would know that this did not keep him from his love of pies. The family moved to Windsor, Ontario when David was 13 years old where he attended WF Herman Collegiate Secondary and played lineman for the school football team.  He went on to study and receive his BA at the University of Western Ontario where he was forever proud to be an Alma Mater. He then studied Asian history for his Masters at the University of Windsor and went on to obtain his law degree at the University of British Columbia. It was at UBC where he met the love of his life, Dianne, his wife of almost 50 years, and met many of his lifelong friends.David began his career as a young lawyer in the downtown eastside at Main and Hastings, in the Ford Building, where he established Guy & Company. He later relocated and practiced in Gastown for almost 50 years, gaining the respect and confidence of the many lawyers he worked with and the many clients he served.David's greatest love was his family, of which he was most proud of.  He would always tell new grandparents - "Grandchildren will change your lives!"  His second love was golf at Marine Drive Golf Club, where he was proud to have served as president and where he developed many lifelong friendships.David will be remembered as an amazing, larger than life personality.  He had a fun loving and witty sense of humour, and always enjoyed telling stories and sharing a good meal with family and friends.  This warm, caring and loving husband, father, grandfather, family member and friend will forever be in our hearts.The family would like to thank all our family and friends who sent messages, cards and flowers of condolence and for the love and support you have given us during this difficult time.The family would especially like to thank the doctors and nurses at Vancouver General Hospital (Neurology Unit) and Burnaby General Hospital; and Dr. John Jue, Dr. Anthony Chiu and Dr. Bruce Chang for caring for David over the years.The family will honour David's life in a celebration of life at a later date.

They raised two daughters and a series of spoiled cats in Rochester, NY, until they eventually relocated to Cornelius, NC.A relentless peacemaker, Borden always saw the best in people and could happily talk to anyone about anything.Borden loved God, the Boston Bruins, the Buffalo Bills, holding his wife's hand, giving his daughters' advice, playing with his grandchildren, and cracking open a cold Canadian beer after working on the yard.

When he was a toddler, his family emigrated to Sault Ste. Marie, where he grew up.  He attended the University of Windsor, graduating with a degree in Communication Studies, and more importantly, starting life-long friendships that he deeply cherished.He was a skilled musician whose first love was the bass.  He loved arranging, Ethnomusicology, guitar, and 'pounding away' on the piano. His innate musicality informed his life and sustained him throughout a career in the TV/Film Industry. David performed in and around Toronto for years and was actively engaged musically until the end of his life.His other great passion was travel, which he shared with his treasured wife, Cynthia Warn. Together they explored Europe, North Africa, East Asia, North America, and his beloved Scotland.  David's many friends will miss his wit and ready laugh. He was a special blend of sweet-and-sarcastic, and thrived on pointing out the ironies of life in a world that he found increasingly hostile to any sane person. But he did so with a charm and warmth that endeared him to a wide circle of friends, colleagues, and neighbours. After spending the greater portion of his life in Toronto, he and Cynthia moved to Cobourg in 2021, and continued visiting his family in Sault Ste. Marie, which he called "God's Country."The foul plague of cancer took David from us on December 13, 2022.  His heartbroken wife and beloved son Richard were by his side.  He is deeply mourned by his parents Kathryn and Charles McLaren and sister Aileen Marsh (Christopher), nieces Sabrina, Callie, Heather and Allison Marsh; nephew and niece Tyler and Victoria Koskenoja; cousins Beve Watson (Jamie) of Edinburgh and Carole Lyon of Aix-en-Provence.  David's sister Marji Koskenoja predeceased him.  His death leaves an empty place in so many lives.There will be a celebration of life on January 21, 2023 in Toronto.

His soul is at rest, and He is with his Holy Father.Raised Presbyterian, Toms' older Brother was a catholic priest and Toms heart knew Baptist had his strong unwavering faith. Tom was one of the strongest Christians I know.I miss my best friend something Big. Tom was my biggest love. My closest friend. My most loving confidant. Tom was My protector. My backbone during hard times. Tom was the love of my life, and Iam so grateful for the 44 years we have spent together. We have known each other since we were 12 years old.I'm going to miss the man that walked in the door after a day of work, no matter how long, how stressful.. didn't matter what had happened that day. He would come in the back door, sit down hislaptop bag and wrap his arms around me. "I love you, its good to be home."We loved weekends away together. Corning New York was a repeat we had done a few times. Making really cool glass trinkets and pendants. Staying at a nice hotel, having lovely meals together and just enjoying driving down new roads together. He had just mentioned going back... not that long ago. Wow, this all happened so fast.Puffins. We needed to see the Puffins. Such a simple thing. But he took me to them on our last big vacation together. Newfoundland. We definitely would have gone back.Tom was my biggest supporter. After working for years in yarn shops Tom was the one that told me that it was time to open my own shop. Tom was the one I shared my shop visions with. He was the one that encouraged and even pushed me to believe in what would come to be known as... Shall We Knit. My dreams were always his too. No one wanted me to fly more than Tom did!Tom Loved his Kids! He dedicated his life to them, to being the best provider he could be, to offer the best guidance he could while showing up, every single time.Tom is already so missed by his eldest Tara and her three kids Darrian, Chance, and Alex. (Daughter in law Tina lost to us in 2022)Tara was a big life lesson in patience for Tom. If anyone could make him question things and re-think things in a different way... it was her! Tara Challenged her Dad. THEY challenged EACH OTHER. Tara was one of Toms biggest loves, biggest challenges and all of it was beautiful to watch them navigate together. Ups and downs. But don't ever cross either of them about the other... or watch out. Loyal to the core. Heart break as a Teen, Tara wanted her Dad. "My dad the hero" ...If you know, you know.Tara will tell you her Dad taught her honour and honesty. To apologize when she hurt someone. To know that the win was in the effort. Tom Loved his Girl so much. Tom couldn't have been prouder of the Woman Tara has turned into.Kyle, Toms son.What Pride Tom had in Kyle. Tom was so grateful to see the strong relationship Kyle has with his Holy Father. This was a relationship which was cultivated by Kyle watching Tom lead in Awana. Awana was a passion of Toms. A place where he was able to minister to children, play games and even obsess about pine car derbies. Tom was so proud of what a great dad Kyle is to his and Ruthanne's four kids! Chloe, Jobe, Boaz and Tekoa. Tom always admired how determined Kyle is and what a skilled worker he is. Tom and Kyle could laugh for hours over silly dad jokes, fart jokes and dry sarcasm. Two peas in a pod in so many ways. Tom loved his son. Kyle was absolutely one of Toms Proudest accomplishments.Kyle will tell you His Dad was the one that taught him to notice the little details. Taught character such as family first, be fully devoted to your wife and kids. Kyle will tell you that showing up for his Kids is a Dad trait. One he learned through years of his Dad being the coach of his baseball team. His dad went to every school event he could make it to. Never saying no to tossing a ball around when Kyle would ask him to. As an adult Kyle and Tom liked to play golf together, go on motorcycle rides together, hang out in the backyard with the grandkids. (Tom LOVED those grandkids of his)Tom was one of three kids. The middle kid! Paul, Toms oldest sibling passed at the young age of 50. Paul was a Jesuit Priest. The story is that they were always at odds with each other (as siblings are). However anytime either mentioned the other it was always with love in their comments and an endearing, strong, proud love.Mary being the baby of the family, she had a special place in her brothers' hearts and carried many family traits between the three of them. Both brothers always tried to take care of the little sisterthrough their whole lives.Then just pile on My siblings... I'm one of a baker's dozen. Tom has been around since I was 12 years old and he has been friends with many of my siblings. Tom started to hang around the Mintz Home with his best friend Dave when they were kids. My Parents, John and Diane Mintz were Toms other set of parents. Loved him and treated him as their own. Tom adored John and Diane. A large respect was carried for John and often Tom would go to John for Spiritual and other advice. Sometimes they just did door to door surveys together... (or did they?) ( If you know, you know)Tom was an incredible human, I'd like to just brag a little about my Man ...He went to the University of Windsor where he obtained a Bachelors of Applied Science. Rocket Scientist Status ( so sexy). He got his Masters in Applied Science at the University of Toronto Aerospace Institute.After we married,( when we were 22) Tom applied for and got a position at Bristol Aerospace in Winnipeg Manitoba where he was involved in the design, coding and implementation of a program that allowed "an airborne object to better find another airborne or stationary object"...that whole rocket scientist status mentioned above. There was a time where he was not allowed to tell me what he did for a living.Guelph- Litton Systems was a place where he continued his work from the previous job at a place closer to both of our families.Strathroy- Self Employed - Crouch Software- Contract work and Custom design software - he always loved a good coding session!Then came the time of internal audit for some larger companies. The first was at The Mutual group which was an insurance company. They were bought by Clarica who kept Tom around. They were then bought by Sunlife who also kept Tom around. He then spent some time at BioVail before moving to Canadian Tire Headquarters which was also one of his favourite stores to visit regardless if he needed anything or not. His work career ended at Blackberry working out of the RIM location.Tom was long winded, opinionated, ridiculously intelligent and had a bizarre love for excel spreadsheets. Tom was a big nerd who loved Star Trek and Lego. If he didn't know how to do something, he would find the right book and just teach himself. Seriously, he renovated the whole basement in our Strathroy home (with very little help from others). Tom Loved Technology and always had to have the newest and coolest techy toys.Tom was amazing.Tom is missed.Tom lives on in so many of our hearts. His love will Carry us through this.Rest my Love. I'm glad you've made it home.		t	NULL	NULL	42.9837	-81.2497

Ray died peacefully with his children by his side.Ray was raised in Toronto's Roncesvalles district, the first-born Canadian of displaced Polish parents. He was an altar boy, Polish Boy Scout, an avid hockey player and swimmer. It was early in his education that he sought understanding of what made the world tick or, for that matter, what made him tick. It was the beginning of his insatiable desire for learning what was going on around him, in the streets and in the world.Ray attended St. Michael's College in Toronto where he played football. He liked to tell the story that during his years of playing, his knee was left on one of those fields. He studied sociology at the University of Missouri and obtained his Master's at the University of Windsor.As a committed progressive lefty, with no place for hypocrisy, Ray was an advocate for the labour movement. It was through his membership with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters that Ray realized how much progress was needed within our social systems. This led him to obtain a law degree from York University's Osgoode Hall Law school. Driven by a fierce independent and unshakable integrity he became an outlier in the button-down old-boys club of the legal profession.In the early '80s, along with his Osgoode law student cohorts, Ray stepped up, when others would not, to help defend the Great Lakes sailors trying, at great risk, to instill democracy in their union. Ray went on to represent vulnerable populations and defend against social and political injustice in Ontario, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Manitoba. He was affiliated with the Criminal Lawyers' Association. Returning to Nova Scotia, he established his own law firm in Halifax where he continued to work relentlessly to fight for the underrepresented.Ray's experiences as a worker and a trade unionist over the years can easily fill a book. He spoke of his experiences through television and radio interviews. He has written and been published. He has presented, lectured and been consulted worldwide. But what stood out most in his mind and motivated him, revolved around the law.Ray was very much alive in this world. He was a person who, as Tennyson wrote, drank "life to the lees." He was a lovable and fun-loving full-bearded biker with a ponytail and a wry smile. His spiritual beliefs rose above buildings of brick and mortar and he sought answers from within himself in quiet solitude. He enjoyed reading, finding grammatical errors in published works, the arts, and music. He enjoyed travelling the open road. His memorable trips included the annual mid-June bike trips with The Illegals Motorcycle Club.Ray leaves behind his beloved mother, Wanda Kuszelewski; children, Nichole and Eric Michaud; their mother, Joanne Michaud; siblings: sister, Dana Kuszelewski and brothers, George Kuszelewski (Iwona and nephew Micheal, niece Alicia); and Edward Kuszelewski (Mira and nephews Mark and Roman). He was predeceased by his father, Walter Kuszelewski.Due to current health restrictions there will be a private viewing for family on the afternoon of Saturday, January 22nd in Atlantic Funeral Home, Halifax. A celebration of life will be held April 8th. Details to be announced.In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to Mission Seafarers Halifax or to your choice of a progressive cause.

Born in Thunder Bay, Ont., he was a son of the late Arnold and Emma (Weeks) Park. Arnold served in the Canadian Armed Forces, with the Royal Canadian Regiment for three years. He then worked in the gold mines in Geraldton and Manitouwadge before attending Lakehead University where he earned his BA. He then attended the University of Windsor, earning his MBA in 1973. Arnold was project manager for various companies in Ontario before moving his family to the Maritimes, ultimately landing in the Annapolis Valley as the Director and COO of Cobi Foods, Inc. He later moved again to begin his long senior management career with McCain Foods, where he held the titles of VP Marketing for McCain Foods (USA) and McCain Foods (Canada); and ultimately served as President and CEO of the Canadian Operations based in Florenceville, N.B. for a decade, until his retirement in 2005. While he continued excelling in his professional life, Arnold and Sandra were feeling the effects of an "empty nest". After learning about an organization called Children's Bridge, they decided to expand their family. Over a period of six years and three trips to China, they welcomed their threeyoungest daughters, Sarah, Molly and Lily. Settling back in Nova Scotia Arnold enjoyed some downtime with his growing family. He served on several volunteer boards including the Children's Bridge, Infoway Health Canada, Nova Scotia Farm Loan Board, and Nova Scotia Justice High Risk Offenders Community Notification Committee. Working upon the vision of his son, Doug, Arnold helped create Cedar Bay Grilling Company Ltd. in 2009 and took great pride in the success of the company which grew from a small plant in Blandford, to an award-winning producer of frozen salmon products bringing the best of Atlantic Canada to homes around the world. Always a businessman, there was no slowing down Arnold even in retirement. An avid bookworm his collection of books was vast and his love for reading was something he passed on to his children and grandchildren. One of the highlights for the kids at Christmas was opening their books from Dad/Grampie. Arnold loved hunting and fishing and especially enjoyed his adventures with his brother John in Thunder Bay. A history buff, especially war history, he spent many hours reading and watching documentaries with his younger daughters. He also was adventurous and enjoyed traveling. Between business and his trips with family, he visited over 50 countries, and was proud to tell stories about his experiences. A strong-willed, hardworker; Arnold cherished his family and we will miss him dearly. We could depend on him for anything knowing he would never expect anything in return. He was a very wise man who wanted nothing but the best for the people he loved. He often sat quietly observing what was going on and could fall asleep anywhere. But he was always on guard when it came to protecting his family. There wasn't a pond, a snowbank or a coffee table that could pose a risk to his kids/grandkids. Survived by his loving wife of 56 years, Sandra (Perry); children, Stephen (Charlene), Doug (Barb), Susan (Richard), Michael, Sarah, Molly and Lily; brother, John (Suzanne); sister-in-law, Cheryl Doi; grandchildren, Tristan, Nicholas, Hannah, Christopher, Gretel, Max, Maggie, Logan, Addison, Grayson and Savannah; a niece and three nephews. Besides his parents, he was predeceased by son-in-law, Scott Forsythe.

Forever missed by her children Adam and Carrie (Ken) and her partner Kathy. She was adored as 'mama' by her grandchildren Brendan, Dylan, and Addison, and she was a special memaw to Julie and Josh as well as Morgaine, David, and Maggie. Beloved daughter of Barbara Montgomery and the late Gordon Montgomery, dear sister to Patti, Murray, and the late Brenda, cherished aunt, and great-aunt to many. Our mom will be fondly remembered by her dearest friend Carol, as well as countless other 'sister-friends' she made throughout her lifetime. A constant companion, her dog Quincy was by her side every moment she was at home. Family was her priority in life, but she was equally dedicated to her career. Starting out at the Women's Interval Home, Gayle worked shift work and attended night school to earn her degree in Psychology at the University of Windsor while raising her children. She then started as a case worker at the County of Lambton in 1990 where she quickly moved into supervisory roles until 2006 when she created a proposal to bring workshops, and poverty reduction initiatives to Sarnia-Lambton. Also, in 2006 she became a facilitator for Bridges Out of Poverty, bringing seminars to frontline workers and people living in poverty. In 2007, Gayle created the proposal to launch the first Circles poverty reduction model in Sarnia-Lambton that was met with overwhelming success and support, since then it has expanded to other cities in the province. Gayle also served as President on the board of directors at the Children's Aid, an organization that she was very passionate about. Gayle was recognized for her career achievements with the Warden's Award of Excellence in 2010, Mayor's List 2019, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Ontario Municipal Social Services Association in 2019. Through her work Gayle travelled across Canada as a nation recruiter for Circles Canada and presenting Bridges Out of Poverty many times to large auditoriums of people. Her presence on the stage was larger than life, and her ability to draw in her audience was amazing to witness as she created the connections with people to create the social change she worked tirelessly to bring to life. The world is a better place because of the work she did and the lives she touched. Gayle didn't strive for materialistic possessions, although she did like fast cars and a good power tool, she lived for moments spent with her family, friends and enjoying the simpler things in life like a cold beer on a hot day, a job well done, playing guitar and a great conversation. The last years of her life were spent right where she wanted to be, living with her children and grandchildren, and enjoying time in the workshop she built that she always dreamed of having after retirement. She loved to travel and the outdoors, with many of her summers spent camping she will be sadly missed by all her friends at her 'camp' in Michigan. Gayle was a fierce supporter of women's rights, social justice, Indigenous rights, and the LGBTQ community. She used her privilege to be the voice for those unheard, and she instilled those values into her children, and grandchildren. Her legacy will live on forever in the work she did, and the social change that she achieved but it's the lives that she touched that would always remain her proudest achievement. A special thank you to all those that supported her throughout her battle with cancer, especially all the healthcare workers at the London Regional Cancer Program, the Chatham oncology unit, the Juravinski Hospital Cancer Centre, and the Chatham-Kent Hospice. Cremation has taken place, friends and family will be received at D.J. Robb Funeral Home on Wednesday May 25, 2022, from 4 p.m. - 7 p.m. Gayle was always most comfortable in her favourite blue jeans and plaid shirts so please join us in honouring her by wearing something comfortable and casual to join us at her visitation.

She followed her heart to earn her diploma in nursing from the Ottawa Civic Hospital in 1956, then a certificate in Nursing Education from UWO in 1958, while working at the Sarnia General Hospital.     In 1962, she married George Feniak, and began to raise her family.  Mary brought all of the energy she had used in her career to her family, making clothes and food from scratch, canning and preserving each year from the garden.  She took courses in tailoring so she could make suits for her husband, as well as clothes for the kids. Mary learned to quilt, and made numerous quilts for her family.  She helped to run a 4H sewing and cooking club, served on the Wyoming Fair board, and much more. Summers were always spent at the cottage, where Mary shared her love of fishing, boating, swimming and Little Whitefish Rummy.  No trip was complete without cinnamon buns and English muffins baked by Mary.   Mary eventually re-entered the working world after earning a Bachelor of Nursing in 1987, and a Masters of Education in 1989 from University of Windsor.  Mary began working for the Lambton Health Unit, and quickly established herself as seniors' coordinator and helped launch the Lambton Seniors' Association.   Mary had a fighting spirit, especially on behalf of others; she advocated for her son, Andrew, for seniors, and for anyone who needed a helping hand.  She gave generously of her time, even after retirement, to her community, but especially to her family. She was a fully engaged grandmother who could be counted on for babysitting, baking cookies, or sewing clothes.  She taught her children and grandchildren her secret recipes, and encouraged them to do their best at home and in the world. Mary had a love for classical music and reading, and was a champion knitter, mostly dishcloths, and could be found watching football, home improvement shows, or murder mysteries on television in later years.   Mary will be lovingly remembered by her husband, George, her children Mark and Alison, her daughter-in-law Serena, and her grandchildren, Katie, Samantha, Marin, Jessica and George.

After quickly realizing he needed more, he graced the renowned halls of the University of Windsor. It was with great honour that Jim found himself in the exclusive residence of Mac Hall.  From flooding the halls for epic slip and slide competitions, learning about the lifecycles of cockroaches, 24 hour marathon euchre tournaments and the late night trips to downtown Detroit; It was here where a more social education happened than an academic one. His favourite classroom being the Bridge Tavern, his friends were many and the stories legendary.Jim led a colourful working career early on in life. From owning a janitorial services company, to selling office supplies in Southern Ontario and even a stint in the financial services industry. These experiences all lead to his career with Stryker Medical. Jim lived by the life philosophy of I work to live, not live to work.It was a breezy early morning in 1986 when a dark haired, mullet wearing, pimple faced boy started dating the love of his life Suzanne. Against all odds, they remained together through high school classes, University lessons and the beginning of one another's career. Long distances and sometimes different countries could not pull the two apart. It was a relationship that was envied by many and experienced by few.  On September 11, 1999, the two joined hands in marriage, ready to take on the world as one but setting the stage for a family based on loveAfter living in Sarnia, Windsor and London he found his way back home in Windsor.  It was here that the family began making their roots.  Finding friendships through social interactions and of course his kid's sports.  The friendships became so much more than he would have expected.  The friendships that were made, turned into another set of family members to him.  The endless love and support that was provided over the years was cherished every day.  Knowing that this was home, Jim joined Beach Grove Golf and Country Club where he and his family could spend their summers golfing, swimming, jet skiing, socializing and developing even more friends. Home is so much more than brick and mortar, it's the community you are part of that creates the fabric to your life story.In 2001, the love story changed and a new chapter began.  Carter was the first born, instantly loved by Jim and Suzanne. Jim's favourite golf partner, his "dude", and sport watching buddy. Laurens birth followed in 2004, where Jim's eyes were opened.  He had his little girl, one to protect and love.  This little girl followed in one of dad's passions, playing high level hockey and golf.  He was her mentor and coach in many aspects of life. 2006 completed their family story with the birth of Avery.  Jim's family was complete with another little girl. He loved her spunk, her passion for hockey and her zest for life.  He taught his children the meaning of integrity, the importance of honesty and how to rise in the face of adversity.Jims love and commitment to family will be his legacy.  He loved his parents Bob and Carolyn and looked up to his big brother Steve in so many aspects of life.  Suzanne's family was never viewed as a secondary, they were an extension of his own.  Suzanne's parents John and Mary welcomed him in with open arms and her brothers Dave, Paul and Mark instantly took him in as one of their own.  It was the incorporation of different beliefs, values and views that shaped Jim into the family man he became.  One that was full of life, passion, dedication and boundless love.Jim's battle with cancer started in March 2012 and the prognosis was bleak to say the least. Jim had one mission from that point on, to bet on all the odds just to have more time with his family.  Joe Louis, Mohammed Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard could not come close to the strength Jim found.  He never wallowed in self-pity, he remained positive, he set goals and no one was to stand in his way.  Through an amazing medical team in Windsor, across Ontario and even in the United States, they remained steadfast to provide him more time.  Through the love of his family, the support of friends and the ongoing medical treatments, Jim defied all the odds and gave us 8.5 more years with himDonations to the Windsor Essex County Cancer Centre Foundation would be appreciated by the family for all the love and support they provided Jim and his family.In honour of Jim and his lifetime of special memories his family is requesting friends to prepare a favourite story, memory or quote that will be placed in a keepsake book for his children and cherished for years to come.Jim was never a formal man and we want this reflected when we join in a celebration of life at Families First Funeral Home.

She started working at Lambton Health Unit as a Public Health nurse and continued there for 26 years until retirement in 2011. Judy's passion was her family. Her pride and joy were her two children. She nurtured and guided them wisely and stood up for them through all of the trials, successes and failures of youth as they grew to be fine young adults. Following over the years, she was blessed with four wonderful grandchildren. She adored them all. Visits, dinners, sleepovers, bedtime stories and outings abounded and a deep loving bond was formed with each of them. Judy was a spiritual woman who lived her life continually caring about and giving to others. She absolutely disliked conflict and always did all she could to maintain harmony amongst those around her. She read voraciously about spirituality and the human condition, and all that that encompasses, especially the greatest mystery, death and dying. She always had a great sense of (usually) dry humour. Oh, how she loved to laugh. This combination of interest and personality led her to quip when talking about life and death, that "NOBODY gets out alive!" Judy enjoyed a life well-lived, but it was cut far too short. She will be greatly missed by all whose lives she touched. Sincere thanks and appreciation to all the doctors, nurses, and staff at Bluewater Health, Palliative Care, VHA, and St. Joseph's Hospice. Special regards to: Sherri and Dr. Crombeen, (Judy's palliative care physician for several months), St. Joseph's Hospice, and Christine Kohn, VHA. Care provided for Judy by all three of these services was universally excellent, professional, respectful and compassionate. Visitation will be held on Friday, August 11 from 4 to 7 pm at the  McKENZIE & BLUNDY FUNERAL HOME AND CREMATION CENTRE  , 431 Christina St. N., Sarnia. Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at St. Benedict Roman Catholic Church, 1011 Oak Ave. at Lansdowne Ave. N, on Saturday, August 12 at 11 am. Cremation will follow.

They were married in 1993 and settled in Cambridge prior to moving to Burlington.

Anne was a beloved and selfless teacher for many years at Pineland Public School in Burlington. When not teaching Anne enjoyed tending to her garden, playing and singing music, baking and reading.

She was instrumental in creating Lambton College's ECE Program and organized the first College Infant-Toddler Certificate program in Ontario. Many of her thousand plus graduates continue to elevate her work for young children through their various professions in this country and abroad.

Beloved daughter and best friend of Alison Irons of Ajax, Ontario and David Wilson of Glencairn, Ontario; cherished stepdaughter of Greg Watson of Ajax. Closest friend of her grieving brother Andrew of Toronto. Adored granddaughter of Stan and Margaret Christmas of Kingston, and Kenneth Irons of St. Mary's; beloved grandniece of Ed and Norah Wright of San Luis Obispo, California, niece of Sheila Harrison of North Vancouver, B.C., Cyndi and James Lang, Arroyo Grande, California, Phillip and Lana Wright of Long Beach, California, Leona and James Cooper of Salt Lake City, Utah, and Chimuka Irons of London, Ontario. Cherished cousin of Kenneth and Jordana Irons of London. Predeceased by her uncle Graham Irons. Lindsay was a compassionate, kind and beautiful soul pursuing the vocation she found in herself at the age of 8 - working in developmental and social services with vulnerable adults, youth and children, while completing her Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Child and Family Studies at Nipissing University's Muskoka Campus. She had hoped this year to be accepted into the University of Windsor's MSW program, had so much to give this world and had her whole life ahead of her. A fierce advocate of the rights of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, she was a valued and beloved employee of Community Living Kingston after graduation as a Developmental Services Worker from St. Lawrence College and later, between university semesters at Nipissing. She loved her work and her "participants" at Kingston Community Options passionately and made many friends there among co-workers and the families she helped. It is a tragedy that she was robbed of her life when she herself was such an unselfish, loving, compassionate and gentle person. Lindsay loved above all her Mum, her Dad, her brother Andrew, her Nanny after whom she was named, her Grandpa and Grandad, her stepdad Greg, her Auntie Sheila, her dog Ethan, and all of her cherished and special friends whom we can't name here because she would be mad if we forgot a single one! You know who you are! She loved taking photos of her friends, learning new things, dancing and listening to music, and being outdoors in the sunshine as she was on the day she died. She wanted to learn to fly, travel the world and have children one day. Deepest gratitude forever to Lindsay's girlfriend Brittany, who was with her when her life was taken from her, to Bracebridge OPP, especially Detective Constable Allen and Constable Bigley, Bracebridge EMS Paramedics and staff at South Muskoka Memorial Hospital who tried so hard to save Lindsay's life. Deepest thanks as well to friends at Ontario Shared Services, Government of Ontario for their love and support to Lindsay's Mum on the day she got this terrible news while at work, and since.

Beloved husband of Anne (Baran). Dear father of Patricia, Nadia, Darusia and Paul Kowalyshyn, and his wife Sandi.John was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba on February 19, 1929 to Nadia (1977) and Yakym (Jack) (1967) Kowalyshyn, immigrants from Volyn Oblast (province), northwestern Ukraine who were very active in establishing the Ukrainian National Federation in Winnipeg. It was only natural that John joined the Ukrainian National Youth Federation (MYHO) where he not only made life-long friends (kumy), but it was here that he met "Baranka", his future wife and life-partner, Anne. He participated in (and later taught) Ukrainian  folk dancing, sang under the direction of Oleksander and Tetiana Koshetz and Doctor Paul Macenko. He was an original member and pro tem co-conductor of the Ukrainian National Youth Federation Choir which, in the sixties, was renamed to honour Olexander Koshetz. John also played the mandolin, violin and trumpet. He was a self-taught musician who, in his later years, dabbled with the tenor banjo, piano and organ and was involved in the production of an album recorded by the Central Collegiate Stage Band directed by Willie Timmermans. In his youth he also played football and hockey and, as an adult he enjoyed badminton, squash and golf. As a young man in Winnipeg, John held modest jobs that included furniture salesman, shoe salesman and bartender. In the spring of 1950, he laid sandbags as a volunteer during the devastating Red River Flood that forced the evacuation of 100,000 people from their Winnipeg businesses and homes. When the family moved to Toronto in 1956, John was employed as a driving school instructor by day and bartender (Stage Door Theatre and the Royal York Hotel Showroom) at night. It was during this period that John became personally acquainted with headliners such as Ed Ames, Perry Como, Edie Gorme, Steve Lawrence and Frank Sinatra. In 1960, John moved his family to Sarnia and was the manager of the St. Clair Hotel, a bustling business owned and operated by his in-laws Evdokia and Stephan Baran. Subsequently in 1965, John and his wife Anne bought the Balmoral Hotel (now Balmoral Tavern) which he ran successfully for some 30 years. To this day, the "Bal" continues to be a family- run operation. John also was an instructor at Lambton College (Bartending: Cocktails and Fancy Drinks) and, with his wife Anne, owned and operated Goliger's Travel Agency in Sarnia for several years. In 1978, at the age of 49, and after eighteen consecutive months of schooling, John was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications and Political Science by the University of Windsor (no small feat considering he had only completed his grade 11 education). John was a respected politician whose career spanned over 20 years of civic service. He was a candidate in the 1974 federal election. He was first elected to the seat of city alderman (councilor) in 1975, was re-elected and served multiple terms on both city and county council. John also sat on or chaired numerous boards including: the Sarnia Police Service Board, St. Clair Parkway Commission, Sarnia General Hospital, Sarnia Lambton Social Services, Lambton Health Unit, Business Improvement Area, Sarnia Public Works, Lambton College Board of Governors, Sarnia Parks and Recreation and the Lambton County Public Works Commission. John also founded the Sarnia Waste Reduction Committee and, as "Master Composter", penned a booklet on composting. John gave tirelessly of himself through many volunteer activities in which he worked as a fundraiser for numerous local, provincial and national charities. He was also a former Rotarian. In recognition of his commitment to the community, John was named to the Mayor's Honour List in 2003. In 1997 John was the first-ever, city- elected person to become Warden of Lambton County. John's dedication to this position was so great that, following an accident in which he fractured his pelvis, rather than miss a county council meeting, he wore his chain of office and conducted the meeting in his hospital room. John's life was full of many personal accomplishments. He was extremely proud of his wife and children, but perhaps one of his proudest moments came in November 2008 when his son Paul was appointed to be a Judge of the Ontario Court of Justice. Divine Liturgy (memorial mass) for the repose of the soul of John Kowalyshyn will be celebrated on Saturday, June 13 at 11:00 a.m. at St. George's Ukrainian Catholic Church, 1045 Rosedale Avenue, Sarnia.

Her home is a tangle of art, animals, and so many people we should have a new township to fit them all. Without her, half the kids in town couldn't play the piano or castle a king. And the other half would never have set foot in an art gallery." - Liz Zetlin, Poet Laureate, ConnectionsIt is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Jane Anne Garland in her 70th year on Friday, September 17, 2021.

Her teaching career began in Mississauga in 1975 and continued in Grey County when she and her family moved to Priceville in 1983. For 34 years, Jane served in a variety of teaching roles within the Durham District School Board, teaching art, learning resources, and industrial arts. From 1999 - 2004, she served as the Behaviour Class teacher at Macphail Memorial Elementary School. A lifelong learner, Jane completed additional training in special education and behavioural studies.Jane valued connection and community and gave generously with her heart, time and talent.

She participated in several group exhibitions and three two person shows in local galleries over the last 15 years. Her artwork was often a reflection of her quirky sense of humour. In 1994, Jane collaborated with local poet Liz Zetlin to produce Connections, a testimony to the power and strength gained from the encouragement of a network of friends.

Brockman passed away peacefully during a short stay at Seven Oaks hospital on August 26, 2021 at the age of 89. Lois was predeceased by her parents, Henry and Agnes Brockman and her brothers, Arnie and Irvin. She is survived by her sister Jeanne, her Aunt Bertha, many nieces and nephews, great-nieces and nephews and great-great-nieces.Lois was born in Humboldt, SK. She grew up on the family farm learning about agriculture and engines from her father, and gardening, baking and canning vegetables from her mother. When she was 15, she attended Ursuline Academy in Bruno, SK where she preferred ice skating and fund raising for the school yearbook, over studying.Her academic excellence, evident from a young age, combined with a passion to serve the welfare of the underprivileged, led her to St. Thomas More College at the University of Saskatchewan where she earned a BA in Social Sciences. She truly enjoyed her time at STM with fond memories of friends and activities at Newman Centre.Lois then worked as a social worker for the Saskatchewan Welfare Department for one year. With a desire to truly dedicate herself to the needy, she decided to join Our Lady's Missionaries in Alexandria, Ontario. As a Novitiate she became Sister Mary Agnes and taught grades 4 through 11. A highlight from this time was teaching the children how to grow container gardens in the classroom. She found that dedication to a cause and religious life were not the same and before her final vows, Lois decided to leave OLM.Now needing to find a profession, Lois recounted her time teaching grade 5 and 6 where she was exposed to eight children who functioned at a grade 1 level, and two others whom the school nurse referred to therapy for emotional problems. She felt the education system had failed these children, prompting her desire to learn more about child development.This propelled her into a master's degree in clinical and experimental psychology at the University of Windsor. There she was encouraged to pursue a doctoral program at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. At Cornell Lois would do her doctorate in child development and family relationships in the College of Home Economics. That year she was also a student resident assistant responsible for 240 freshman girls.In October 1964, Lois moved to Lima, Peru to do her dissertation research in the Barriadas for six months where she studied malnourished children. Working with these children and parents was true missionary life.Upon completion of her Ph.D., she taught in the psychology department at the University of Saskatchewan for one year, the University of North Dakota for four years, then received an invitation from Home Economics at the University of Manitoba to assist in developing their new Department of Family Studies.Strong child studies programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels were developed during her tenure. Her research focused on cognitive development in infancy and early childhood, on memory, sensory and language development, and mastery motivation. She was a principal investigator on the 1988 National Child Care Survey, the largest social science survey conducted in Canada to that date.In 1974, the University of Manitoba honoured her with the Graduate Students Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching. In 1985 she was awarded with the Dr. & Mrs. Ralph Campbell Outreach Award. Another of her career highlights was being asked, in the 1980's, by then MLA Muriel Smith, to Chair a committee to establish the certification of childcare training programs in the Province of Manitoba.Lois retired from teaching in 1997 just as the Red River was about to flood the city and her Winnipeg home. She continued to serve as a Senior Scholar and later in her retirement became an active member of the University of Manitoba Retirees Association, serving as President from 2002 - 2009, and helping to establish scholarships and bursaries in their name.In her spare time Lois enjoyed attending the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, curling at the Pembina Curling Club, doing the annual bird count, and gardening. In her later years, she enjoyed watching wildlife cross through her back yard, from her deer, to woodchucks, to her beloved chippies.A private family service will be held at the Neil Bardal Funeral Centre, on Friday, September 10, 2021 at 11:00 a.m. The service will be live-streamed and available to view on Lois's obituary page atwww.neilbardalinc.com.

He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Sumiko; children Rika (Nikolai), Mika (Colin), Kengo, and Yuka (Chris); grandchildren Akira, Tatsumasa, Kenta, Junko, and Aya; and two sisters and their families.Juhachi and his twin sister Kiyoko were born in Tokyo, Japan on October 19, 1943. As the baby of the family, he was doted upon by his late mother Fumi, loving sister Yokuko, and late brother Shogo. In his youth, he developed lifelong passions for science, the outdoors, origami, martial arts, music, good stories, and good food.He met Sumiko at an origami exhibition and, in March 1969, they married. They emigrated to Canada in August 1969 for Juhachi to attend the University of Windsor, where he earned a Ph.D. in nuclear physics in 1974. In 1976, Juhachi began a 35-year career as a radiation physicist with SAL and the Canadian Light Source at the University of Saskatchewan.Juhachi enjoyed his work as a scientist, often working into late hours of the night, but for his kids, he was a devoted dad, shuttling us to a multitude of lessons and activities. Dad spent many years setting up chairs on Saturday mornings for the Saskatoon Youth Orchestra, attended our concerts, listened to countless hours of practicing, and made us believe that we sounded wonderful. He remained a very intense music listener and developed an idiosyncratic cataloging system for his CD collection.Juhachi was also an avid sports fan and an accomplished martial artist who practiced karate for many years in his youth and Kendo in later life with the Saskatoon Kendo Club. He loved outdoor activities-camping, hiking, birding, butterflying, and walking down 14th St. with a series of beloved dogs, Frosty, Oliver, and Kota who also survives him and will miss being Dad's good boy.Dad's illness progressed too quickly. As the days and months unfold, we will be constantly reminded of the things he looked forward to doing, the projects left unfinished, and trips that he planned to take. These range from his anticipation of the next installment of Louise Penny's mysteries, to family trips to Cypress Hills and Japan. We especially regret that he was not able to find and photograph a last few species in his effort to complete Butterflies of Saskatchewan.Dad was a very private and modest man with surprising and varied accomplishments. We will miss his sense of humour, his perspectives on the many things that interested him, and his steadfast love for us. A celebration of life will be held on August 23, 2019, 2:00-4:00pm in the University Club at the University of Saskatchewan.In lieu of flowers, donations in Juhachi's honour may be made to the Conservation and Education Fund of the Saskatoon Nature Society (https://saskatoonnature.org/donate/).

He was appointed vocation director (1973-1975) for the Edmonton Province. In 1975, he was asked to join a new mission preaching team, on which he served for almost 25 years (1975-1984, 1991-1998 and 2002-2010), travelling to parishes across Western Canada. Fr. David was a true son of the prairies and felt most at home with the flat earth and open skies. He observed that, "there's an unhurried, patient quality about a prairie spirituality." Between appointments to the mission team, Fr. David obtained a Masters of Arts degree in spirituality (1985) at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh and served as director of formation and the novitiate in Edmonton (1985-1991). His warm smile and his gentle heart made him a compassionate channel of the Good News of Jesus, in his preaching and in a very powerful way as a confessor and counsellor. In 1999, he returned to his home parish of St. Joseph's as the last Redemptorist pastor. The order left the parish in 2002. Based in St. Mary's parish, Saskatoon, he returned to preaching missions until retirement. Among the Redemptorists, there are only a few who were seen as "giants" in their preaching of Parish Missions. Fr. David can be counted among those who were gifted to move people to a conversion of heart by his preaching. Close to his death, he shared with his old mission partner, Bob Williston, that there is only one thing more he'd like to do before going to heaven; to go and preach some missions once again. Vigil prayers for Fr. David will be on Tuesday, March 26 at 7pm with Mass of Christian burial on Wednesday, March 27 at 10:30am. Both celebrations take place at St. Mary's parish, 211 Avenue O South, Saskatoon. In memory of Fr. David, donations to the St. Mary's Parish Nurse Program will be gratefully accepted.

He was born and raised in Sudbury to his loving parents Burt and Nancy Crane. He attended Lockerby Composite High School and then attained his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Windsor before receiving his Bachelor of Education at the University of Western Ontario. After graduation Alex moved to Essex County where he worked as an art teacher at Essex District High School. Alex was the dearly loved husband and best friend of Ann Connolly Crane (Keast).

He will be lovingly remembered by his brother-in-law John David Keast Jr. and sister-in-law Lesley Mitchell.

Alex was passionate about hockey and for many years he played with the Kingsville Kings, the Wheatley Oldtimers, and the South Point Senior Men's Hockey. He will be missed by his circle of hockey buddies. Alex was particularly proud of The All Ontario Championship when he played for the Lockerby Composite Vikings. Summers spent on Trout Lake energized him and this was reflected when he was kayaking, canoeing, taking long swims, walking on the camp road or just relaxing in the sauna. Other interests included biking, roller blading, reading, writing poetry, dancing, listening to music, travelling, gardening and decorating the exterior of his home. Alex had a mystical and spiritual like lens with nature, marvelling at the smallest aspects of the Creator's magnificent design. This insight served as the foundation of his artistic talents and personal creations of oil, acrylic and watercolour paintings, sketches, caricatures and other art pieces. He experienced great peace when he immersed himself in the unparalleled beauty of the waters and shores of his beloved Nepahwin Lake, Trout Lake and Point Pelee National Park. Alex had a great affinity for people. He had a legion of friends. He did not judge others, always seeking to understand and relate to the positive. He made others feel special.

In loving memory of Charlie MacIsaac, 63 years, who passed on suddenly, with his loving wife Jessie at his side.   "Friends and Family, Charlie has left the building. . ."   If you're looking for him, you'll find him at a Ranger hockey game or in his smoking room at home, still cheering for his New York Rangers. He'll be wearing his blue Ranger jacket and one of his Ranger jerseys. He'll readily show you his hockey collection: Andy Bathgate's Scoring Leader 1955-1956 card; his three NHL Registered Goal-Pucks of Brad Park, Jean Ratelle and Bill Fairbairn in 1972; and his rookie cards. He'll tell you he saw #4, the great Bobby Orr of the Boston Bruins, play live, at the Montreal Forum or Maple Leaf Gardens. An avid armchair athlete, during baseball season he'll be in his 1992 Blue Jay World Series Champs sweatshirt and he'll glance at his Roberto Alomar rookie card, Pat Borders MVP baseball and 1992 World Series baseball signed by all the Blue Jay Team. Or you may spot him at the annual Elvis Tribute Artists Festival in Collingwood. . . He'll quiz you about Rock 'n Roll history and his personal favourites; Eddie Cochrane, Gene Vincent, Buddy Holly, Ronnie Hawkins, and of course Elvis Presley. He'll tell you he saw Elvis perform live in Las Vegas at the International in 1972 at the height of his talent.  He'll reminisce about the concerts he attended at the Grand Theatre or at the Sudbury Arena: George Thorogood, Paul Anka, Bare Naked Ladies, Celine Dion, k.d. Lang, Lee Aaron, Englebert Humperdink, Burton Cummings & Randy Bachman. Wearing his Phantom of the Opera jacket was one of his trademarks. And if you're at Sudbury Racetrack Slots, you just may spot him in the dining room collecting on a winning horse race ticket or playing the slots. Charlie grew up in Sudbury, graduating from St. Aloysius Separate School and St. Charles College and then studied at Laurentian and University of Windsor. He was close to all his family and enjoyed summers on Lake Penage in his youth. Charlie was a gentle man, easy to be with. His was a generous spirit. Not a person of many words, he had acute powers of observation and was very perceptive.

Dr. Pasquale "Pat" Galasso died unexpectedly, at home, and we are deeply saddened to share this news. Pat leaves behind the love of his life, Janet "Jan" Galasso, his wife of 63 years, along with his three children and their families: Kari (Ken Arnold) and their two children Mackenzie and Jeremy, Linda and her son Jay, and Mike (Kelly Galasso). Pat was predeceased by his parents Costantino and Carolina Galasso and also by his two brothers Anthony and Joseph. He leaves his nieces and nephews; Cicely, Anton, Chuck, Al, Shandra, and Darin, as well as his great-niece Ava Galasso who shares Pat's birthday: February 17.Pat was born in 1930 in downtown Toronto. If you asked him, or even if you didn't, he would jump at the opportunity to share details of where and how he grew up. He was born in a small row house at 67 Elm St., very close to the bus terminal. He claims that he was in the original "B&B" district with a bootlegger on one side and a brothel across the street. He credits the brothel owner's German shepherd (that was often let out to chase kids away) with the inspiration for his track and field prowess.Pat's parents instilled in him an extraordinary work ethic and the belief that education was the key to success. Inspired by these fundamental values, Pat was awarded three degrees throughout his academic career: a Bachelor from Queen's, and a Master and PhD from the University of Michigan. Pat's dedication and hard work led him to excel beyond the classroom: in his favourite sport, track and field, he was the two-time Canadian Long Jump Champion. He also had an outstanding career as an administrator in the field of Physical and Health Education and as the founding Dean of Human Kinetics at the University of Windsor. Upon retiring from Windsor, in an effort to continue to provide for his family, Pat became a Financial Advisor with Sun Life and worked in this field for 10 years. When Pat finally retired in 1996, he and Jan returned to Kingston where they had first met years ago at their alma mater: Queen's University.All of this was possible because of the role Jan played as the most wonderful homemaker and mom three kids could ever ask for. Pat's devotion to Jan was unrivaled and, even to his last days, his focus was on Jan's health and wellbeing. Pat and Jan enjoyed a vibrant life in Kingston. They were involved with Queen's University, the Canuck Club, Edith Rankin United Church, active endeavours through the Seniors Centre, the Liberal Party, ballroom dancing and the Common House in their community. And all of these things would take a back seat if a family member needed support or if there was a game, concert or recital to attend. Pat was endlessly proud of his children and his grandchildren and, again, if you asked (or didn't) he would be very happy to tell you about each of them and their accomplishments.Pat will be remembered for many things but one thing in particular will be his incredibly infectious laughter. His laugh would resonate above all others at any gathering. He was often laughing at his own jokes but to his credit, he was a very funny man!Pat has been cremated and, when the time comes, Pat and Jan's ashes will be mixed in an urn as per their wishes - to be together for always.Preliminary plans are being discussed for a Celebration of Life on Saturday, April 6. In the meantime, if you wish to make a donation in Pat's name, he would greatly appreciate a contribution to Toronto Sick Kids Hospital or a cause of your choice.Jan, Kari, Linda and Mike would like to extend their sincere appreciation to all the people who have reached out, dropped off food and shared beautiful messages of condolence. Your gestures and kind words have meant a great deal to us and have made such a difference as we deal with this incredible loss.

Bishop Hill was ordained in the Anglican Church as Deacon in 1948 and priest in 1950 (Diocese of Ontario). He served parishes in that Diocese, spent several years at St. John's College, Cambridge England, where he also served as Chaplain, and he was a professor of Church History at Canterbury College, University of Windsor. From January 1975 to January 1981 he served as Bishop of the Diocese of Ontario, followed by two years as Assistant Bishop of Montreal where he lived as an ecumenical Oblate of Dom John Main's Benedictine Priory. In 1981, Bishop Hill was asked by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Runcie, to serve as the Anglican Co-Chair of the Anglican-Orthodox Joint Doctrinal Discussions. From 1981 to 1998, he travelled widely among the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches, at the request of the worldwide Anglican Primates. He did his ecumenical work primarily through personal conversation and by praying with the various orthodox communities he visited. The friendships he created between the Anglican Communion and the Orthodox churches deepened the association between the churches and continue to have a profound effect on our mutual understanding. He founded the Scholarship of St. Basil the Great, to continue to promote friendship between the Anglican Church in Canada and the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches and the Assyrian Church of the East. From his days at St. John's College in Cambridge, Bishop Hill was a member of the Oratory of the Good Shepherd, an international association of Anglican priests, and was responsible for establishing a strong presence of the Oratory in Canada. He was also an Associate of the Sisterhood of St. John the Divine, and in 1984 came to live at St. John's Convent, in an apartment attached to the Convent. He was a spiritual mentor to the Sisters, broadened their international and ecumenical vision, and brought to the Convent many friends from across Christian and other faith traditions. He was a spiritual mentor and soul friend to many throughout the Church, forming many ecumenical and inter-faith friendships. He was the Episcopal Visitor of the Community of Jesus in Cape Cod, MA and had close connections with the Grenville Christian College in Brockville, ON. Bishop Hill's most profound gift as teacher, preacher, bishop, and ecumenist was undoubtedly the gift of prayer and spiritual friendship.

He was surrounded by his immediate family and buoyed by messages and prayers from family and good friends from all stages of his life. Herman was born March 16, 1942 in Timmins, Ontario and attended elementary and high school there. From early on, he had a "joie de vivre" that was second to none. In his early years he was a prankster and the very incarnation of Denis the Menace. Herman graduated from U of T - or more accurately, U of T survived - until Herman graduated with a B.Sc. in 1965 and M.Sc. in 1967. In those years Herman refined his tastes from explosive pranks and legendary parties to a man that lived by the scientific method and found the love of a lifetime with his wife of 56 years, Patricia Bruckman (nee Mahoney). Together they shared a lasting love of travel. Shortly after graduation, Herman became a high school teacher and later joined the founding staff of Sandwich Secondary School as the inaugural head of the Science Department in the year 1970. He loved teaching chemistry and physics and his students often commented on his ability to make difficult concepts in chemistry and physics clear and exciting. Herman was granted his M.Ed. in 1977 from the U of Windsor. In 1988, together with Al Cruickshanks, a teaching colleague, he co-authored a widely used chemistry textbook "Understanding Chemistry." His inspiring teaching was recognized with the Prime Minister's award for teaching excellence in 1994, and he helped to develop new teachers as an instructor at University of Windsor's Education department. Herman was one of the kindest, most loving human beings ever. He opened his heart and his home to colleagues, friends, students, family members and strangers - anyone who wanted to share a meal, a drink, a conversation, or just needed shelter from some storm in their lives. Around the dining room table of the house that he literally built with the help of his family, he held incredibly engaging conversations that left lasting impressions on the frequent guest as well as the occasional visitor. He is predeceased by his parents, Herman Sr. and Georgina (nee Beck) Bruckman and his sister Grace Daypuk. His memory will always be cherished by wife Patricia, sister Carolyn James, children Andromeda (John) Sulja and Orion (Amy) Bruckman, his five grandchildren Jaromir and Jasminka Sulja and Takoda, Atlas, and Hudson Bruckman.

It is with deep grief the family of Murray Wade of Lamont, AB announces his sudden passing at the University of Alberta hospital due to a severe stroke at the age of 58. Murray will be profoundly missed and forever remembered by his loving wife of 25 years, Audrey Dobrowney, children Vanessa, Matthew and Nicole (granddaughter Michaela), sister Lynda DeBuck (Maurice), step-mother Mary Wade, aunt Freda MacDonald (Graham), brother-in-law Walter Dobrowney (Susan) sister-in-law Connie Hubley (David), numerous nieces, nephews and cousins and special friends Ian Pennoyer and Allen Carter. Murray was predeceased by his mother Mary in 1984, his father Kenneth in 2011 and his in-laws Nettie and William Goble both in 2012. Murray was raised on the family farm in Wallaceburg, ON and attended the University of Windsor 1972-1979 leading to his Honors BSc, MSc, and PhD in Theoretical Physics. During his working career he was employed by STSC Inc., Petrosar Ltd., DMR Group Inc., Right Associates, Peopletech Consulting Inc. However, his independent spirit and entrepreneurship led him in 1994 to found his own consulting business. As President of Redline Advisors Inc., Murray consulted to a myriad of corporations both here in Canada and abroad. He was a gifted writer and researcher and authored and presented many papers on business methodologies that he developed. He was an engaging communicator and was invited as a keynote speaker for a variety of functions. He was highly respected in the business community for his intellect, integrity, efficiency, humor and his down to earth, no nonsense, let's get the job done approach. His professional accomplishments aside, in his heart Murray always considered himself a farm boy and cherished the strong family ties, life lessons and character building that it fostered. He always chose to live in the country, raising animals and having a big garden. He was first and foremost lovingly devoted to his family and they were always his priority. Although Murray was fiercely independent and self-assured, he was humble, kind and considerate, with a high degree of empathy, compassion and generosity for others. His hand was always out for those who cared to grasp it. He respected his intelligence and intellect and always looked at life's situations as an opportunity for learning. He was always ready for a spirited philosophical discussion on any topic. Murray had a wonderful sense of humor; he liked nothing better than to hear or tell a good story followed by his hearty and infectious laugh. Finally, he was an honest man - he lived his life with integrity, according to his values and principles, and never wavered from them. For his family and friends, it truly was a privilege to have Murray a part of our lives. A good man gone, much much too soon. In accordance with Murray's express wishes, there will be no funeral or memorial service. The family would like to express their sincere thanks to the emergency staff in Lamont Hospital, STARS ambulance and the critical care staff in ICU 3C3 at the University of Alberta Hospital. The compassion, honesty and dignity, coupled with the excellent care shown to Murray and our family is much appreciated. Donations in Murray's memory to any of the above would be most appreciated by the family.

Purtell, Judy passed away suddenly from complications of diabetes at the age of 75. She was predeceased by her parents, Frederick Albert Carter and Betty Carter (nee McIntyre) of Oakville and Kincardine, Ontario, and her much loved brother, Sandy Carter (Maureen), of Burlington, Ontario.Judy's advice was, "Don't be afraid to adopt." Fred and Betty adopted and loved their little baby girl, and gave her a comfortable home. They passed on many of their traits - wit and humour, stubbornness, love of dogs and skill in their handling.Judy was an unforgettable character who always had a twinkle in her eye - two parts humour and one part mischief. Despite everything, she always managed to land on her feet and reset her course.Judy left high school early, but earned her Ontario College Social Service Diploma, followed by an LLB at the University of Windsor, and an MSW with additional Certificate in Gerontology from Wayne State University. Judy worked in youth social services in the Toronto area before moving to Windsor for her law degree. She practiced law with the Crown Attorney, and then with a Windsor firm where she won over judges with her creative defence arguments. Judy worked for the Province of Ontario supervising youth offenders before a long career  as a social worker at St. John Detroit Riverview Hospital and Home Health Care in Detroit. Judy wound up her career supporting seniors with her work at the Alzheimer Society of Windsor & Essex County, and with the local Home Instead.Judy met Anne in 1990 and they married in 2005, shortly after Ontario legalized same-sex marriage. They settled in Amherstburg with their family of Corgi dogs. As social workers, they shared a love of helping others and sticking up for those left out, and as partners they found humour in every situation.Judy left us too soon, but her lively spirit will stay with us. As per Judy's wishes, cremation has taken place. A celebration of life with family and friends will be held at a later date in the spring.		t	NULL	updated	42.3	-83.03

At the age of 11 he and his family fled, amidst fighting, eventually travelling to northern Germany and more than a year later arriving in eastern Austria.  There his parents and two surviving sisters lived in one room along with his niece Erika.  As a stateless refugee he could only attend up to middle school, so at 16 he began to apprentice as a cabinet maker, learning to do fine woodwork.  With his friend (and later brother-in- law) George he immigrated to Canada in 1953, soon moving to Windsor and becoming a Canadian citizen.   The young Canadians group at the Windsor YM/YWCA became his family, and it was there he met the love of his life, Eunice in 1957. They married in November 1958 and were together 66 years until she passed on 21 December 2024.   Their sons, Neil and Kirk were born in 1959 and 1962.  In 1968 Emil and Eunice adopted Cindy a beautiful, healthy 9-month-old baby.  They built their lives in South Walkerville in a house which he personally remodelled.  In 1968 Emil and Eunice bought  a cottage and three acres of land near Oxley. He renovated it and after retirement, building an addition almost by himself.  With Eunice and his family he lovingly looked after the property, planting more than 40 trees of different varieties.  It became the place for family reunions over the years on warm summer evenings around bonfires he built by the lakeside, with songs and many marshmallows roasted by his grandchildren.His limited formal education did not stop him from becoming active in the Carpenter's Union and being a founding member of the NDP in 1960 along with other friends who later became members of parliament, city councillors, and mayor of Windsor.   He was an original member of the Windsor Unitarian-Universalist fellowship and subsequently of the Olinda Unitarian-Universalist Church where he applied his skills  to repairing and renovating the one-hundred-year-old building.  When he retired at 65, he took courses at the University of WindsorThroughout his life Emil overcame many challenges:  surviving the deep physical and spiritual wounds to his family in 1944/1945; arriving in Canada as a 21-year-old with $20 in his pocket but soon making his living by applying his skills to doing the fine woodwork for new churches.  In Windsor's turbulent economy he found a long and stable job with Chrysler as a maintenance carpenter.  He overcame a near fatal car accident, and a few years later being electrocuted. Six years ago the effects of a fall confined him to bed for five months, but he came back from that to walk again, and to bring much happiness and laughs to all those who helped him and then cared for him.He was a devoted  grandfather to Nicholas and Christoph in Switzerland (with whom he enjoyed speaking German), to Maria and Eric in Victoria and Hap in Bracebridge, and more recently, great grandfather to Lottie, who was with him shortly before he passed.He survived all his family members:  his parents Josef and Mara, his brother Stefan, his sisters Katharina, Josefina and Anna and his niece Erika.Emil was a strong, hardworking, multi-talented man who overcame great challenges in his life to be a supportive and inspiring husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and friend to many. Together with our mother Eunice they were parents to be proud of.A Memorial Service will be held for both Eunice and Emil on 1 March at the Olinda Unitarian Universalist Church		t	NULL	NULL	42.3	-83.03

Though her loss is devastating, her children and grandchildren take pride in calling her their mother and grandmother.Darlene was the second oldest of four sisters born in Fort William, Ontario. Raised by a strong matriarch, Zelda Muzzin, Darlene grew up with a foundation of resilience, love, and the belief that women should be educated. She followed her calling to nursing, entering training at St. Joseph's Hospital in 1958 and graduating in 1961.For Darlene, nursing was never just a job; it was her vocation. She dedicated her career to geriatric and palliative care, providing compassionate, dignified, and thoughtful care to her patients. She often formed deep bonds with her patients and their families, ensuring that no one faced their final moments alone. Despite the emotional toll, she never wavered in her commitment to being there for others.Her greatest joys in life were her children and grandchildren. Darlene loved making big family meals, baking everyone's favourite squares, gardening, and sharing newspaper clippings on everything from politics to recipes. Whether babysitting, attending hockey games on FLO TV, or showing up for dance recitals, she was always present. Her thoughtful gestures, like leaving newspaper clippings on kitchen counters, were small but meaningful tokens of her enduring love.When her children married, Darlene welcomed their spouses and extended families with open arms, embracing them as her own. Her love knew no bounds, and she made everyone feel like an integral part of her family.In retirement, Darlene pursued her love of learning and community. She attended Elder College at the University of Windsor, sang with the Windsor Community Choir, and avidly supported the symphony. She also found joy and connection at the Life After 50 Senior Centre, where she cherished her friends and activities, from Zumba classes to coffee chats. Her retirement was vibrant and purposeful—a model of how to live fully.Though life brought its share of hardships, including the profound loss of her son Michael, Darlene faced every challenge with resilience and grace. She found joy in life's moments and taught her family to do the same.In a note to her children, discovered taped to her will, she wrote words that encapsulate her essence: "May your impact on others be kind, and theirs on you be loving. And may you always, always, know and remember how I love you with all my heart, now and forever."We love you too, Mum, with all our hearts, now and forever.Visitations will be held at Windsor Chapel Funeral Home – Central Chapel (1700 Tecumseh Rd.

Born on July 10, 1931, in Windsor, Ontario, she was the third of five children to Earl Barron of Amherstburg, Ontario and Mary Barron (nee: Barry) of Buffalo, New York.

A dedicated employee of the hospital for over 30 years, Pat loved her career and the many cherished friendships she made along the way.

It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of John Sanko, affectionately known as Gigi to so many people.   Surrounded by love, he left this world as he lived - deeply cherished by his family, friends and countless lives he touched. He was a loving and devoted husband to Charlene for 61 years. A caring father to Ron (Stephanie), Jay (Natalie) and Tanya (Pete) ... Gigi was the cornerstone of our family.   Of all the roles he played in life, being a Gigi was the one he cherished most.  His greatest joy was his grandchildren, whom he loved beyond measure.  Whether cheering from the corner of the rink, sharing stories or offering words of wisdom, his love and pride for each of them were endless.   His legacy will live on in the hearts of all seven; Luke (Kristin), Jack (Amanda), Brianna (Adam), JJ (Kaitlyn), Vic, Cameron (Ness) and Marc. John cherished the beautiful relationship he had with his sister Rosalie and brother Jimmy. He was predeceased by his parents James and Mary, his brother Ron and sisters Shirley and Patricia. He always held a special place in his heart for all the dogs in our families.  You could often hear Gigi whispering to one of them, "Who's your best buddy?', knowing quite well that if they could answer it would be "Gigi".   All the dogs will miss you and the never-ending table scraps that you provided. John was born and raised in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario and then moved to Windsor in 1960 where he completed his degree in Honors Business at the University of Windsor.  This is where he met the love of his life and set down roots for the next 70+ years.  His career span from Hudson Bay Company to owning his own business "Bumper Mart" and finally retiring from the WECSSB.  He was a proud Heritage Member of Beach Grove Golf & CC and will be missed by all his Sunday morning golfing buddies.  Gigi was also a lifetime member of the Knights of Columbus. It was in the Soo where Gigi's passion for hockey began.   He dedicated much of his life to minor hockey, whether it be coaching, working for Hockey Canada or simply having those much needed "hot stove" discussions in the arena lobbies.   His unwavering love for the game and all the hockey families made a lasting impact on everyone who knew him. Beyond the ice, Gigi was a man of kindness, humor and wisdom - always ready with a story, a piece of advice or a helping hand.   His love for his family was boundless, and his legacy of generosity, dedication and love will live on in all of us. Visitation will be held at Windsor Chapel Funeral Home - Banwell Location, 11677 Tecumseh Rd. East, Windsor (519-253-7235) on Thursday, February 27, 2025 from 1 pm - 4 pm and 6 pm - 9 pm with parish prayers at 7:30 pm.

MacNeil, and older brother Donald, Lenore passed away Boxing Day, in her 95th year.  Lenore was a devoted wife of the late Jimmy Simpson (2013) for 63 years and loved her son Rick until the end.  She was a wonderful aunt to Karen Smith (2024), loving great-aunt to Alexis Smith (Simon), and second mother and mentor to many.  She loved her nieces and nephews Bob, Paul, Anne, Carol, and Susan.Lenore created lifelong friendships with her classmates from nursing school in the 1950's in London, where she then worked as an OB-GYN nurse.  She was blessed with friends she collected like family in all facets of her life.  She and son Rick lived in many cities while Jimmy, a Military Veteran, employed by Chrysler, was moved across Canada.Finally, they settled in Windsor, where Lenore set up her business, Lenore Simpson Personnel.  Many may remember her iconic billboards across town, and many credit her with the launch of their own careers. When they stopped her in the street, she always remembered their names, their spouses and even their children!A woman ahead of her time, she was often the only woman in a room full of businessmen, exuding a disarming confidence and charm.  She relished volunteering in the community, bringing her friends with her.  She was Chair of the Board of the Better Business Bureau, on the Board of the Chamber of Commerce, the Windsor Execs, and she was a fixture at the Windsor Yacht Club!Most will remember the life she breathed into the room when she entered it.  Bedecked in the latest fashion, her jewelry was show stopping with a ring on every finger.  She was known for her red hair, a jockey style hat to go with every outfit, and more recently, eyeglasses completely covered in rhinestones.Despite her success in business, she remained humble, with a self-deprecating humour. She rarely talked about herself, but always wanted to know how you were doing. Whether in their careers or in their personal lives, people sought her advice.  From her they always got the truth, but she was kind about it, and many remained in her life for decades.Truly the life of the party, she spent many an evening trying new martinis, Saturday lunches at the Bay, and playing bridge with the girls in the afternoon. Later, when health matters limited her outgoing style, she still enjoyed lunch at the latest café or restaurant, while remaining most loyal to the Windsor Yacht Club!She enjoyed the company of her many girlfriends who came to visit regularly. Her "daughters", as she called them, were devoted to her, and helped in so many ways.  Randy Dugal (Theresa 2020) was her ever ready handy man. Louise spent many evenings with her. Ruth made oodles of soup. She was especially thankful to her niece Karen and great-niece Alexis Smith who spent every holiday in Windsor for many years.Anu Banskota, her caregiver, will miss her dearly.  We thank Anu, not just for her kindness to Lenore, but also to Jimmy for many years.  We are grateful for many years of care from Dr. Pat Smith, and to Dr. Sheldon Lewis, who Lenore often said was the best cardiologist in the world.Lenore Simpson will be honoured in perpetuity with a scholarship in her name at the University of Windsor.  It will assist women business students who she hoped would go on to start their own businesses as she did.  We would be grateful if, in lieu of flowers, donations were made to "Lenore Simpson Memorial Scholarship, University of Windsor", in care of Families First Funeral Home.Lenore, who always said, "flowers don't last long enough", will be long remembered for her remarkable life. We will miss her.  Friends are welcome to wear all their bling to Lenore's celebration!Cremation was held.

An amazing husband, father and grandfather. Husband of Anna (Cerget), father to son Christopher and wife Margaret (Bunn), son Brian and wife Deanna (Cincurak), daughter Laura Ann and husband Peter (Dobrich). Predeceased by son Kenneth (1980). Grandfather to Jessica, Spencer, Forrest, Garrett, Landis, Brennan, Kendra, Aleksandar, Danijela and Stefan. Survived by sister Druscilla Rose, brother Danny McCallum and wife Christina.Predeceased by mother Rose Fillar (Thomson Hancock), father Harry Hancock, step-father Walter Fillar, in-laws Julius and Gizela Cerget, brother-in-law John Cerget, as well as wonderful grandparents Rose and William Thomson.Donald was born on Peter Street in the Town of Sandwich in June of 1936. He attended Prince of Wales School, among others. Following his graduation from W.D. Lowe Secondary School, he worked with local Architects until 1965. During the Summer of 1965, Donald was hired by then Riverside Board of Education to teach Architectural Drafting at Riverside Secondary School. While at Riverside, he assisted the senior football team and coached the badminton team to a Southwestern Ontario Championship. Following ten years of classroom teaching, including two years as supervisor of the evening school program at Riverside, he was promoted to Technical Director at Centennial Secondary School where he taught Architectural Drafting as well as interior design. He assisted the senior football team and continued his University of Windsor studies which he had began while at Riverside.During this time he became the first Technical Teacher to be selected to participate in a Ministry of Education Program to train Secondary School Principals. Following a two year summer program, Donald was promoted to Assistant Principal at William Hands Secondary School.  This position was held for five years prior to being relocated to J.L. Forester Secondary School, also for five years.While continuing his administrative work at J.L. Forester, Donald completed a general B.A. and Masters of Education Program at the University of Windsor. During his years at Forester he was involved with the School Revitalization Program, directed in large measure by a very active "Parents For Forester" led by Larry Renaud, as well as Doris and Roger Yaeger, among others. This group of leaders along with many parents and students filled the Windsor Board auditorium one evening at a Board Meeting. A fine presentation by Mr. Renaud and the overwhelming presence of parents and students convinced the Board to vote in favour of keeping the School open.Following these events, Donald was reassigned to the Hon. W.C. Kennedy Collegiate Institute. During this time he acted as recording secretary and eventually chair of the Windsor Association of Secondary School Principals. Having completed five additional years of administration duties, he retired in 1993.Much of Donald's success is owed directly to his wife Anna, as he traveled six summers outside of Windsor for various academic upgrades, and an additional eight years of summer and evening classes to complete his University studies. During all of these times, Anna was alone raising four children and did it very well indeed.Thanks must be given to Dr. C. Watling, London Health and Sciences Centre and Dr. M. Winger, Windsor, whose efforts and care, gave him the extra time to enjoy the marriages of his children as well as the births of his grandchildren. Also a special thank you to Dr. O'Callahan and staff and all the doctors and nurses who cared for Dad during his short stay at Windsor Regional Hospital - Met Campus and Ouellette Campus.Donald has requested a private family funeral followed by cremation and interment along side his son Kenneth at Green Hill Cemetery in Kingsville.

Proud and loving mother of Dylan and Fiona. Dear daughter of Emily Rich and Thomas Ley, and daughter-in-law of Maureen Nelson. Cherished sister of Laura Turner (John), Robert Ley (Lauren), Andrew Ley (Kali), Ryan Ley (Kati) and sister-in-law of Heather Stephenson (Joe), Ambrose Kirby (Haley) and Kathleen Gomez (Julian). Beloved Aunt to numerous nieces, and nephews. Amy will be missed by many aunts, uncles, cousins, extended family and friends.Amy was born in Lansing MI.  Her loving and supportive parents encouraged and nurtured her love of music and she grew up playing piano, violin, and the harp.  As she studied music further at The University of Michigan (BM, MM) she became convinced that playing the harp "was something, from the depths of my heart, that I had to do." Amy touched the lives of countless people through her brilliant musicianship, immense humanity, and unending warmth. In her hands, "the harp, that most heavenly of instruments, glowed even brighter."Through teaching, she engaged in the best learning experience of all by working with harp students in her home studio, at Hillsdale College, the University of Windsor, and at the Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp. She inspired parents and children in Windsor by teaching the basic fundamentals of music in her Music for Young Children programs.   Her home was always full of music.Amy was the Principal Harpist, often featured soloist, for a number of orchestras in her home state of Michigan and adopted province of Ontario. She could play a heartfelt "Pachelbel's Cannon in D" for a teary-eyed bride, groove to an arrangement of Gershwin with her Detroit-based Modern Harp Quartet, and buzz with the "what next" of a new composition played with Brave New Works.  She was featured in broadcasts and recordings on CBC radio, numerous live webcasts, and summer festivals in Washington and Lancaster OH.Championing classical music in her home community of Windsor, Amy was a founder, Artistic Director, and regular performer in a chamber music series called 4th Wall Music whose goal was to connect to new audiences by taking down the wall between audience and performers with programs that were educational, interactive and collaborative.Amy was passionate about her family.  As a loving mother, she was a fierce supporter of her children and was active in their school and activities.  She was a beautiful and loving partner to her husband and together they relished the immense joy that their children brought.  As a family, they flourished in their "village" in Walkerville.  A friend to all, she sought out connections with people throughout her life and was blessed to find herself in a community of amazing women. She would find peace and solace walking in a forest, diving into a lake, on a stroll with her beloved Loki and Koda, and marvelling at the world around her.The family would like to thank the entire staff of The Windsor Cancer Centre and the Hospice of Windsor for all their dedicated care and compassion shown to Amy.

He was exceptionally well-read and had a fondness for both fiction and non-fiction. He also loved old movies, Agatha Christie mysteries, and quoting Monty Python at every available opportunity.Though his reviews occasionally ruffled feathers, he approached his work with the utmost respect for Windsor's cultural scene. In his farewell Windsor Star column he wrote, "I have been blessed with having a thriving arts community to cover. Organizations, to name a few, that have made my job a joy include Windsor Light Music Theatre, the Windsor Symphony Orchestra, the Art Gallery of Windsor, Caesars Windsor, Windsor International Film Festival, MediaCity, Windsor Jewish Film Festival, BookFest, the drama programs at University of Windsor and St. Clair College, Kordazone, Theatre Alive, and Theatre Ensemble, all the high school arts programs whose numbers are in decline, sadly, 20 to 30 amateur and semi-professional theatre groups across Windsor and Essex County, hundreds of musicians who work for pennies because they can't imagine doing anything else, Art in the Park, Carrousel of Nations, Bluesfest International, Kingsville's Folk Festival, Fork & Cork, Tecumseh Cornfest and the LaSalle Strawberry Festival."

She is survived by three children, Richard, Mary (John) and Susan (Sandy). She was grandmother to Austin, Sean and Kassidy, and a great-grandmother to Charlotte. The youngest of six children, she was predeceased by all of her siblings. She is remembered fondly by her late husband's sisters, Evelyn (James) Waterman, Edna (Thomas) Vaughan, Margaret (Donald) Cunningham, and Chris (Peter) Maroon, as well as by numerous nieces and nephews. Win was born November 7, 1927 and grew up in the Boston area. She considered herself a "Mainer" due to longstanding family ties there, including a family home which she bought in 1950. While a very modest house, it had a million dollar view that she never tired of looking at. Family vacations were spent there every summer and she was able to continue to visit every year until her late 80s, but she always hoped she could return to live there. She was studying for a degree in Horticulture (1957) at the University of Maine, where she met her husband.They married and relocated to Iowa for his doctorate, moving to Canada in 1962. They bought their house in Harrow in 1967, where they lived until moving to assisted living in Kingsville in 2019. While raising their four children, she became particularly interested in psychology and pursued a Masters of Education (1975) part-time at the University of Windsor. She taught courses in psychology at St. Clair College and worked for the Essex Family and Children Services agency. She later returned to the University of Windsor to study full-time for her Master's in Social Work (1988). Win was an active parishioner of St. Anthony's Church in Harrow. She belonged to the Catholic Women's League and served several times as President. For many years, she was on the phone almost daily to discuss league matters with other members, especially with her very good friend, Margaret Csendes. She was a lector and lay communicant, and also did pastoral counselling. She enjoyed reading and was interested in a wide variety of topics and kept an impressive reference collection of newspaper and magazine clippings. She became an absolutely voracious reader of mystery novels in later life, sometimes outstripping her children's ability to keep her well supplied. Win and her husband enjoyed travel and always included trips to gardens wherever they visited. There was a steady succession of fresh flowers from their garden in the house from spring through fall. Win liked to bake and there were almost always sweets to be found in the cookie jar or in a cake pan on the counter whenever her family visited.An afternoon coffee break was a steady feature in family life and outings to Tim's were included in most excursions. She enjoyed birdwatching and collecting stamps and coins. This included never passing up on the opportunity to pick up a lost penny. Although she was introduced to playing solitaire on the computer, she preferred to use playing cards, which she would wear out in pursuit of the perfect game. Win had a dry sense of humour and a sharp wit that served to remind us that, despite a severe hearing loss, she was very much with it until her final days. She passed peacefully on November 9, two days after turning 97. We are very grateful to Deborah Wamsley and the staff at Highview Residence in Kitchener for their kindness and care of Win in the two years she lived there. She will be greatly missed.Burial will take place on Tuesday, November 19, 2024, at 11 a.m. at Colchester Memorial Cemetery.

Although her activity level had declined since she stopped driving two years ago, she was determined and very happy to stay in her home, which was the centre of her life in so many ways.Katherine was predeceased by her husband Robert K Little (1928 - 2012), and her parents Blake Pierce (1902 - 2001) and Norma (Anderson) Pierce (1900 - 1982).   She was the much-loved mother and grandmother of: Robert B (Debra Deane) and children Robert M (Jana Brown), Nicholas (Laekin Anania), Jonathan and Erick (Selin Gul); Thomas (Ann Sutherland) and children Darby (Greg Dossett) and Dawson; Susan Warnock (Steven Warnock) and children Bridget (Andrew Filbey) and Brenna.Born in Middlesex County near London but raised in Windsor ON from the time she was a toddler, Katherine's star shone bright academically which resulted in her skipping two grades in elementary school.   The summers of her youth were spent at her parents' cottage in Rondeau Provincial Park.  After graduating from Walkerville Collegiate Institute (Windsor ON) at the age of 16, Katherine attended the University of Western Ontario and completed her Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree and her Registered Nurse (RN) training at Victoria Hospital (London ON) in 1954.As is often the case, Katherine's early adult experiences proved to be some of her most memorable.  As a student nurse at Victoria Hospital during the 1950's polio epidemic, Katherine learned that sometimes compassion and a hand to hold was the only thing she could offer when medical remedies failed and patients her age or younger succumbed to this terrible disease.    Upon graduation, Katherine worked for three years as a V.O.N. nurse in the East End neighbourhood of Hamilton ON.   Her patients were blue-collar workers and laborers, many of whom were new Canadians with minimal English-language skills.   Many of these patients sent her home after her visits with home-baked food, and always greeted her warmly upon her return.  One patient, whom Katherine helped with a long and difficult home birth when the doctor did not arrive on time, named the baby girl "Katherine" after her.At the end of her time with the V.O.N in Hamilton, Katherine and her closest friend Marg Reeve (Martin) decided to travel throughout post-war Europe and the UK together.  It was quite an adventure for two young Canadian nurses who had never been away from home.  Katherine loved telling of how adroitly they were able to deal with overly-friendly Italian soldiers on the trains, their not-so-graceful lefthand driving skills in the UK, and how relieved they were when Katherine's parents spontaneously met them upon the return of their ship to Montreal because they only had twenty-dollars left between them!   Katherine and Marg were best friends in elementary and high school, were in the same nursing class at Western and worked together for the V.O.N..In 1956, Katherine moved to Windsor ON and began working as a nurse at Hiram Walker and then the Chrysler Assembly plant.  It was during this time that she met her husband-to-be, a tall, young man named Bob Little.   Katherine and Bob were married June 8, 1957 in Windsor ON and went on to have three children.  While Bob began to grow his insurance brokerage business, Katherine focused entirely on her family.  During the turbulent 1960's and 1970's, she instilled a sense of fairness, equality and a commitment to helping others that she was remembered for throughout her life.  In addition to being a full-time Mom, Katherine enjoyed her involvement in the I.O.D.E and the Questers Canada, and as well as singing in the choir at Riverside United Church for over 40 years.   Katherine was also a lifetime member at Beach Grove Golf & Country Club and very much enjoyed spending summers at the cottage in Morpeth ON.    Land and sea travels worldwide with Bob became an exciting part of their lives, especially in the 1990's and 2000's.Katherine had a great sense of style and elegance.  Her graciousness and her ability to always have fun was remembered fondly and admired by everyone who met her.The family wants to thank Jennifer W, Stephanie, Jennifer C, Grethel, Amy and the scheduling team at Amy's Helping Hands.   Their care, compassion and professionalism was wonderful and it meant a great deal to Katherine and her family.Katherine and Bob helped many people throughout their lives and quietly donated to organizations to help make a difference in the life of others.  In lieu of flowers, donations would be welcome to the any of the organizations listed below.  A private family interment has been held.

Survived by his devoted children, he will be missed by Cynthia (Guy Jammes), Curtis (Carla Brewer), Charla (Jim Parkinson), his dear niece Janine Kovach (David Bugaresti) and his devoted partner Pia Petretta who together enjoyed many happy years of love, fun and adventure.  He was predeceased by his cherished wife and best friend of nearly 50 years Elsie Cusinato (née Padovan). As Nonno, he was adored by his grandchildren Riley, Jacob, Caroline, Justine, Callum, Darren, Christopher, Mason, Connell, Sloane and Olivia who were privy to Tony's many legendary stories and the life lessons he learned along the way.    He grew up on Glengarry Avenue in Windsor and spoke often of his early days in the neighbourhood and as a rink rat at Windsor Arena.  Throughout his life he found pride and passion in the game of hockey and played almost to the age of 80. Tony is the loving brother of Elsa Cusinato.

Tony attended Assumption High School and St. Michael's College where he played hockey.  He completed his undergrad at the University of Windsor before he graduated from Osgoode Hall in 1962.  In 1968, he embarked on a successful law career starting his own firm with his long-time friend and law partner Al Gatti which eventually grew to become Cusinato, Gatti, Wright and Godard.  His love of the law was a constant inspiration to many whether he was in private practice or as a federal Justice of the Superior Court of Ontario for close to 28 years.  He cherished his time on the bench and felt fortunate to be working and doing something he loved every day. Throughout his life, Tony was proudly active in many volunteer roles and served on many boards.  He was always extremely generous in giving back to his community including his support of the Rotary Club of Windsor, as well as a founding member of the Pointe West Golf Club. The family is deeply grateful to Amy's Helping Hands for their exceptional care especially by Grethel Sessing who was his long-time caregiver extraordinaire.

Missing him deeply are his best friend and wife Barb, dearly loved daughters Jacie and Katie, son-in-law Kris Perta, and adored granddaughter Siena. Also shocked and saddened by our sudden loss are his big sister Ester, nieces Eva, Ann and Tina, along with their families including his great-nieces, great-nephews and great-great-nephews, as well as his many dear friends. Peter was born in Estonia and grew up in Toronto's Beach neighbourhood. During his final year as an undergraduate at McMaster University in Hamilton, Peter took a spontaneous trip to Fort Lauderdale Florida where he happened to meet Barbara McPherson on the beach. They hit it off, and shortly after Peter came to the University of Windsor Law School where they started their lives together and never looked back. His two daughters meant the world to him and he was supportive and involved in everything they did. They were his buddies and his treasures. He was also an amazing "Grampy" to Siena, always participating enthusiastically in her creative requests. He loved the experience of being part of her developing world. Peter practiced law in Windsor for more than four decades. He was involved with his community, chairing the board of the former Windsor Western Hospital, and supporting the University of Windsor, WIFF and the Windsor Symphony Orchestra. A life long sports enthusiast, Peter was always either a participant or a spectator. In his younger days he played rugby and hockey. After moving to Windsor, he developed a passion for golf and enjoyed his games with the guys at Essex. More recently Peter became interested in duplicate bridge, which he and Barb enjoyed playing together (most of the time!). He was also an avid reader and member of a book club. Pete and Barb loved to travel and never missed an opportunity to visit their daughters wherever their adventures took them. After he retired from McTague Law Firm, they had the opportunity to visit many more parts of the world. Pete particularly enjoyed meeting and chatting with new folks they encountered on their trips. Chatting was one of Pete's many talents: he would walk their beloved dog Ruby every day, chatting with neighbours along the way. His favourite time to have a good chat (or debate) was over a delicious meal with family and friends. Enjoying a dram of scotch or a glass of red wine with good conversation was something Pete always looked forward to - especially on the porch at the family cottage in Port Sydney. He will always be there with us. Peter had the ability to make everyone around him feel comfortable and welcome with his easygoing nature, clever sense of humour, and genuine curiosity. He will be remembered for his kindness, his wisdom and his bright smile. All those whose lives he touched will miss him very much. If you wish, donations can be made to the Windsor Symphony Orchestra or Windsor Regional Hospital Foundation - Cardiac Care in memory of Peter. Cremation has taken place as per Peter's wishes and a celebration of life will be held in early April.

1061	Sean Ganley	Sean	Ganley	NULL	January 17, 2024	Windsor	Ontario	2024-01-20 00:00:00-05	https://windsorstar.remembering.ca/obituary/sean-ganley-1089296048	GANLEY, Sean FrancisNovember 26, 1946 - January 17, 2024"If you're not having a good time, it's your own fault."Sean passed peacefully in his sleep on January 17, 2024, following a significant health struggle in recent years. Sean fought that battle with intense determination, ever refusing to stay knocked down, and beating the odds time after time.He leaves behind his loving wife of 51 years, Mary Lou, who was a life partner in the truest sense, and provided unwavering support on Sean's long medical journey; his son Patrick (Kathy) and his grandson, Sean (b. 2022). Sean was so grateful to spend time and bond with his namesake for the last year, the two shared special moments together, including spilling tea and biscuits on their shirts and hard-fought staring competitions.Sean was born on November 26, 1946 in Athlone, County Westmeath, in the heart of Ireland. The Ganley family immigrated to Canada in 1956, landing in their new home, Windsor, Ontario. The third of fifteen children, Sean enjoyed growing up in Windsor and doing his best to stay out of trouble, spending many long summer days on the banks of the Detroit River and swimming in its strong currents.Sean set goals and then set out to attack them. Graced with good looks and witty banter, Sean found success at a variety of interesting jobs prior to attending the University of Windsor in 1970. That decision paid off, as it's where he met the love of his life, Mary Lou, who he quickly fell in love with. The two of them let the good times roll, taking many cherished trips over years including a road trip across Europe, sailing around the Caribbean, and returning to Ireland to visit family.Sean and Mary Lou married in 1973, and began a life in Toronto shortly thereafter, where Sean started his career at the Campbell Soup Company. In his 16 years at Campbell's, Sean worked his way up to Manager of Distribution and Warehousing. This kicked off a successful career in distribution and logistics, where Sean's leadership, creativity and ability to solve problems took him to a role he greatly enjoyed - Director of Logistics for the Hudson's Bay Company. Prior to his official retirement in 2011, Sean oversaw all Canadian distribution centres, and spearheaded the construction of one of Canada's largest DCs in Vancouver, British Columbia.Sean was a devoted and loving father to his son, Patrick, with whom he shared an immense bond. Sean did more than show up to watch games, taking on important and impactful roles of coaching, managing, and fundraising for many baseball and hockey teams. Some of the happiest years of his life were spent as "Coach", another role he excelled in. He's served as a coach and a mentor to so many, on and off the field, regularly offering important life lessons that weren't short on fun.In 2011, Sean and Mary Lou moved back to Windsor just as Sean always dreamed of, a house on the Detroit River with a dock and a boat. Sean enjoyed many days and evenings on the water, just as he had over 50 years earlier, regularly taking family and friends out for "evening cruises", or sitting in the backyard watching the sun bounce off the river as it set over the Detroit skyline.An avid sport and fishermen, Sean took every chance he could to get on a golf course or in a fishing boat. He also enjoyed a rugby career that lasted longer than Mary Lou or his employer thought reasonable. Sean fondly recalled the many golf and fishing trips with family and friends over the years, and cherished time spent taking Patrick on fly-in fishing trips with their close friends; often feeling recharged after return from the freedom and lawlessness of "Man Camp".A good Windsor boy, Sean was a die-hard fan of the Detroit Lions, Tigers, and the Michigan Wolverines. He had remarkable depth on each team's roster including who was on it, where they came from, and what was expected of them. Ball games were not to be missed, and anyone who caught one with Sean knows there is "no chit chat when the game is on". Sean loved hosting legendary Super Bowl parties, and although he never saw his Lions win one, he stuck around long enough to see their first playoff win in 32 years.You could regularly catch Sean with a line in the water sitting on the break wall at the "Riverhouse". If Sean wasn't on or in the water, he could probably be found working out in his garage, fighting back against every physical ailment that came his way, taking every step they said he'd never take again. He received some tough hands, and consistently beat the odds, always personifying a true rage, rage against the dying of the light. Despite his decline in health, he maintained his wit and unparalleled sense of humour, steadfastly refusing to let his pain impact those around him.He kept his mind sharp. He immersed himself in reading and keeping up to date on current events; he was an encyclopedia of information on so many topics, from finance and geopolitics to automobiles and economics. If something caught his interest, he would pursue it with keen curiosity until he understood all sides of it. There wasn't a subject you could bring up that he didn't know something about, or have an opinion on. He enjoyed insightful discussions and debates with anyone who wanted to step in the ring over a cup of tea at his kitchen table.Sean was beloved and will be deeply missed by family and friends in Windsor, Toronto, across Canada and around the world. Sean was predeceased by his parents (Sean 2002 and Marion 2010), and by his brothers Bernard (2004) (Denise 2018), Patrick (1952), Ciaran (2022) and Dermot (2021). He is survived by his siblings Michael (Colleen), Maura (Larry 2020), Deirdre (Doug), Jimmy (Joan), Cathleen (Greg), Brendan (Shelly), Colm, Alana (Elio 2022), Emmett, Aileen (Chris) and sisters-in-law Rose, and Debra. Sean will be missed by many nieces, nephews, grand-nieces and nephews, as well as cousins in Canada and Ireland, all of whom he shared tremendous memories with over the years.The family would like to send a special and heartfelt thank you to Dr. Mark Wheatcroft at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, his vascular team, and a long list of talented and caring nurses and professionals who provided Sean with world-class care and let us all spend more time with him. We are so grateful.Time to rest now, Sean - your work is done. You did so well. May you rest in peace, always lifted by the love of those to whom you've given so much.Cremation has taken place.

This led to a long career as an elementary school teacher in North York where he taught at Wilmington, Rockford, Kenton and RJ Lang.

Countless guests enjoyed their hospitality and Dad and Mom loved the interaction. They volunteered at Soldier's Memorial Hospital and were founding members of the Probus Club of Orillia. Their final years were spent at the condos at Leacock Village where they continued to meet wonderful friends.

When he was a young boy, his family was re-united in Canada, in North Bay, Ontario. He spent the duration of his youth there, until he attended the University of Toronto where he earned a B.A.Sc. in 1942, followed by a M.A.Sc. and a Ph.D., all in chemical engineering.In 1948, Frank married Mary Valenti. They had twelve children: Maria (deceased 2001), Anna Moore (Jack), Jeanie, Paula, Chris (Brian Riera), John (Martha Ndokuo), Dan (Kim), Tom (Hisano Motobashi), Jim (Stacey White), Terry (Fraser Godfrey), Robert (Linda) and Jerry (Anne Bell). Frank is also missed by 26 grandchildren (Mark, Steve, Dom, Jocelin, Jamie, Juliann, Georgia, Trevor, Glenn, Jenny, Stephen, Mike, Nick, Alexandra, Michael, Jackie, Robert, Laura, Thomas, Ollie, Sam, Alex, Matt, Adrian, Kestrel and Cassie) and 17 great grandchildren.Frank's work years comprised a distinguished academic career in Windsor, Ontario. Over a course of more than 40 years, his name figures prominently in the University of Windsor history - as a founder, professor, athletic director, first Dean of Engineering, first Vice-President, and Professor Emeritus.Frank's teaching career began in 1946 at Assumption University. When Essex College began, as Windsor's first public university-level institution to receive provincial funding in 1956, he had the distinction of being the inaugural Principal. Essex College offered degrees in engineering, business, mathematics, nursing and science. Frank's role was central when it later evolved to become the University of Windsor.All who knew Frank are familiar with his affinity all-around for athletics. In the 1940s, Frank played in the Ontario Rugby Football Union, the highest level of Canadian football. He went on to coach both football and basketball teams at the college level. His enthusiasm for golf became a decades-long source of enjoyment, not without some frustration. Curling was another long-term favourite sport, ranging from high-level competition to a social pastime with his wife, Mary. Frank's induction into the Windsor and Essex County Sports Hall of Fame in 1996 was a special recognition.Frank must have intuited the key to longevity through keeping active almost to the very end. He partook in many activities, such as swimming laps, swinging a racquet or a club, paddling a canoe and riding a bike, including a three-wheeled bike when he could no longer ride a standard. 'Applied' exercise included hours of yard work such as raking the interminable supply of oak leaves on his LaSalle property. He resided there in the family home for over six decades, thanks in a large part to receiving, in his later years, a huge boost in countless ways from his son Dan and family living on an adjoining property.The DeMarco family home was also the location of many joyous family reunions over the years. Having endlessly enjoyed teaching and coaching his own children and grandchildren, Frank always showed overflowing pride in their academic and athletic accomplishments. His family motto was "Sempre Avanti" (Always Forward), which sums up the dedication and drive that were evident in his pursuit of excellence in family life, in career, and in athletics.Frank will be dearly missed by all of us.Deep gratitude goes to Dan and Kim and their children for enabling both Frank and Mary (deceased February 25, 2021) to enjoy their peaceful home and property right through to their end of life. We have also been fortunate to have Ella Muzzin's care and friendship over many years, as well as several very special caregivers from Amy's Helping Hands, CarePartners, ParaMed, St. Elizabeth and the LHIN.In lieu of flowers, the family has requested memorial donations to be made to the DeMarco Award fund (student-athlete scholarship) throughwww.uwindsor.ca/donate, (either under Athletics, select "Dr. Frank DeMarco Memorial Fund"; or as a Tribute Gift).A celebration of Frank's life will be scheduled at a future date.

After graduating from the University of Windsor, Frank explored places beyond his hometown but frequently returned to visit.Frank's remarkable career spanned decades and continents. He made a name for himself as an accomplished financial executive. His innate savvy in finance, funding, and fixing, earned him the admiration and respect of the business community. Although not all of us witnessed Frank in action, countless private and public companies benefited from his unique expertise.Even in retirement, Frank continued to pave the way by working on specialized projects and collaborations.

An avid traveler, having organized so many trips with her husband, Ted (predeceased 2020) and children Walter (Debbie), Loraine (Kevin), Gloria (Grant) and grandchildren Isaac, Gabriel, Cameron, Katrina, Erik and Evan, she always left room for unplanned adventures. Sandra lived life to the fullest, until the end.Sandra was a natural communicator. She spoke five languages and taught Modern Languages full time at St. Clair College and part-time at the University of Windsor. As a teacher, in addition to classroom instruction, Sandra keenly felt the importance of her role in mentoring students, especially young women. This support continued with her work as a member of the Ontario Advisory Council on Women's Issues (1983-1988), where she fought to help sole-support mothers obtain affordable housing and daycare. Sandra excelled at networking, bringing people together through the arts, in particular, music. Having grown up attending concerts and operas at La Scala, Sandra continued to pursue her interest in music in Toronto as one of  the founding members of the Toronto Bach Society (1957) and by serving on the Symphony Orchestra Guilds in Toronto, Halifax, and most recently, Windsor. Sandra felt that music was a unifying language and to that end, she set up an endowment fund, through the Windsor Symphony Orchestra, to assist in advancing the careers of young professional vocalists.For their excellent care, we wish to thank: Dr. A.

Their marriage gave her new life, energy and an opportunity to experience the world with her love. She spent her years both with her family in Canada and new-found family in France. Her happiness came from spending time with the ones she loved and cooking delicious meals for them. Holding Christmas gatherings, dinner parties, and broadcasting the Matassa family reunion were her specialties.The greatest joy in Mary's life came from spending time with her Grandsons, Son, and Daughter-in-law. She will be remembered by Liam and Logan for giving the best cuddles, hugs, and singing lullabies as they fell asleep in her arms. More than a mother-in-law, she was an advocate and supported Rose in her pursuit of further education and career fulfilment. Mary provided a shining example of how to be a wonderful wife, mother, grandmother and friend. As a mother, Mary always put her son Michael  first without question. She made the mold of what a parent should be. Kind, patient, supportive, loving and at times strict.To those who knew her well, her worth was immeasurable and her impact on them was undeniable.In the present we mourn her loss, but as we weep here on earth, we know that heaven has gained another Angel.Visiting at Families First, 3260 Dougall Ave., South Windsor, 519-969-5841 on Thursday, July 20, 2023 from 3-5 and 7-9 p.m. Visitation continues on Friday, July 2, 2023 from 10:30 a.m. until time of funeral service at 11:00 a.m. Cremation to follow.

The four children soon followed as Ray embarked on his long career as educator for the Windsor Separate School Board. Ray was the first Special Education teacher for the board and a forerunner in his field. Over a period of several years, with hard work and dedication, Ray obtained his BA degree from the University of Windsor.Upon retirement, Ray and Marie moved to their farm, the Bar-C-Ranch in Dobbinton, Bruce County, where they made new friends and enjoyed new experiences. He dabbled as a gentleman farmer in cattle, chickens, and Clydesdales. He enjoyed having a garden and took pride in the annual harvest.Ray was a self-taught handyman who did a complete home restoration of the Bar-C-Ranch and loved furniture refinishing in his workshop. In 2014 Ray and Marie moved back to Windsor.Throughout life Ray's decisions reflected his commitment to his family and Catholic Faith.

After earning a degree in physics from the University of Windsor, Michael served his community for over 30 years as a hilarious, kind, and intelligent physics and science teacher at Orangeville District Secondary School. Even when he could no longer work, Michael continued to share his knowledge through his website and youtube channel. Michael is survived by two daughters, Keira and Brynn Colautti, who were the most important part of his life, his wife Sharon Adler, his niece Carleigh Montello (nee Elliot), and nephew, Dean Elliot. He was predeceased by his parents John Alexander Colautti, and Jeanne Elaine Colautti (nee Tutton), and his siblings, Linda Marie Stropkovics (nee Colautti), Jeanne Elizabeth Elliot (nee Colautti), and Anita Louise Colautti. Michael was the youngest of his siblings, and always a loving son and brother. Michael involved himself in more activities than can be listed, including: scuba diving, woodworking, writing, music composition, cooking and the creation of elaborate halloween costumes. He lived to put a smile on the faces of his daughters. There is no way to adequately summarize his life, or the gift that was knowing him.Visitation will be held at the Dods & McNair Funeral Home, Chapel & Reception Centre, 21 First St., Orangeville on Tuesday, July 11, 2023 from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Memorial donations to an education fund for his children would be appreciated by the family.

1109	Dorothy Badregon	Dorothy	Badregon	NULL	June 25, 2023	Windsor	Ontario	2023-06-28 00:00:00-04	https://windsorstar.remembering.ca/obituary/dorothy-badregon-1088482273	BADREGON, Dorothy Genevieve (nee Jenich)Teacher and Vice-Principal, Metro Toronto Separate School BoardMarch 14, 1943 - June 25, 2023It is with the deepest sadness that the family of Dorothy Genevieve Badregon announces her passing on June 25, 2023, at the age of 80. Predeceased by her father Joseph Jenich and her mother Helene (nee Cottell). She is survived by her husband David Sr., sister Fran Robich (Ivan), daughter Susanna (Patrick Turner), son David Jr. (Paola Prieto). And four gifted grandchildren: Alexander, Victoria, David III, and Emma. Dorothy would remember reaching 80 years with some satisfaction, but for her, the fewer people who knew her age, the better. Dorothy would remember, above all, her immediate family. Her husband of 54 years, David, was lucky to tag along on her numerous adventures. Daughter Susanna, the oldest, made her mother proud with an accounting career, while son David Leo became an able engineer with a predilection for building subway systems. Dorothy would remember growing up on Alexis Road in Windsor, Ontario, where her father Joseph Jenich worked at the nearby Chrysler auto plant, while her mother and her champion, Helene Cottell, served as head registered nurse at a local hospital. In the fields and along the roadways, Dorothy and her sister, Fran, exulted with their friends in the joyous freedom of the young. Even here Dorothy loved to take charge, intuitively and inconspicuously, an innate leader. Dorothy would remember the many summers spent on her grandparents' farm near Wallaceburg, Ontario. Here she would help her idolized grandparents with a variety of chores, including driving the tractor and herding cattle: she was not afraid of anything, really. Dorothy would remember the one summer spent at Camp Gay Lea in Ontario's Muskoka region, not as a camper, but as a member of the kitchen staff. At least the weather was pleasant. Dorothy would remember her years at the University of Windsor, earning a degree in Honours History. When a suitable teaching job was not available, she pursued a Master's degree, writing her thesis, of which she was justly proud, on "Thomas Jefferson's View of the City." Dorothy would remember meeting her future husband, David, while working at her usual university summer job as a waitress at Windsor's noteworthy Tunnel Barbeque. Here she was seldom flustered, and always engaging. Customers often insisted on her being their server. She knew how to get on the same wavelength as her customers. High social intelligence was an early virtue for her. Dorothy would remember accompanying her husband to Philadelphia's University of Pennsylvania for graduate school. Initially she worked as a librarian in the science library, helping emeritus profs track down research. Later, she moved to the state social services bureau, where she served as a social worker, helping others better their lives wherever she went. Often she would hear young children cry out, "Momma, Momma, it's the Social Services lady coming." She was not afraid; she could pivot to give others opportunities. Dorothy would remember discovering her antiques addiction here, spending many a weekend in Amish country hunting down old chests, and chairs, and you-name-it. And who could forget Williamsburg, with its mahogany highboys, and four poster cherry beds. Later, back in Ontario, antiquing became a hunt for mid-nineteenth century Canadian harvest tables, hutches, armoires, tables and, especially, old student desks (she never met an antique desk that she did not desire). Dorothy would remember moving with her husband to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. As she drove in to the capital, Regina, she begged her husband not to stay in the province any longer than necessary. She would come to love her new province, however, obtaining her Bachelor of education degree, and finding a teaching job at a rural elementary school. Here she found, the "1, 2, 3 shoot" teaching method for basketball served her well (but how??). Dorothy would remember returning to Ontario, and beginning her teaching career with the Metro Toronto Separate School Board at North York's Chaminade College School: she never forgot the young men that she taught, with their joys in learning and living and accomplishing great things. Over the years, many of these students showed that they never forgot her either. Dorothy would especially remember her time as vice-principal at St. Joseph's Wellesley, and the well-loved principal, Sister Conrad Lauber, CSJ. Here Dorothy would hone her ability to relate to students, parents and teachers, and to bring everyone together to facilitate students' accomplishment. Rather than spending a chunk of her day looking at a computer screen, she spent it interacting with students in the cafeteria and throughout the school. Here her morning mantra on the announcements, "Enjoy your learning," was born, and was to tag along with her during her career. As Dorothy explained to a local newspaper columnist in 1992, "I'd start the day with 'O Canada' and a prayer and then I'd say, 'Enjoy your learning,' I want their learning to be positive, enjoyable. I wanted to tell them, 'Carpe diem,' [seize the day]. This is the best time of your life...because all of a sudden, it's yesterday." Dorothy would remember vice-principalships at other Toronto schools, including Loretto Abbey. She often enthused about working with principal Linda Langero, the Loretto sisters, and the talented teaching staff. Many a trip she took to the outside environs supervising students. Dorothy would remember the family cottage on Long Lake in the Haliburton Highlands. She would say that she wished that she could have spent more time in the summers there, relaxing on the deck or sitting on the dock with her feet in the cold water. Instead, she was often writing provincial History curriculum, taking courses, or serving as summer school principal. When she was there, she relished the campfires (even though she once accidentally put her foot in the campfire emergency bucket), cinnamon breakfast buns at the local bakery, and antiquing forays into the nearby villages. Dorothy would remember her wanderlust throughout her life. While in Philadelphia, she organized a summer-long trip to Europe, visiting many a museum Madonna, too many she finally admitted. As with any new visitor to Europe, she was overwhelmed with the centuries of history and culture. Still, after dragging her suitcase to a shabby and dirty rented room in London, she insisted on pulling that darn suitcase back to a cleaner flat in Bloomsbury. She knew what she wanted, and was willing to go the extra distance for it. Dorothy would remember seeing the world, often on guided tours or cruise ships. She stood before Egypt's Sphinx, and watched her husband enter Israel's Jordan River (she was not getting wet, however). She permitted her husband to visit too many a winery, from Australia to New Zealand, to California and Italy; she was a watcher, but not an imbiber. She enjoyed the art at St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum, and even got side-lined at the nearby Peterhof Palace, without the proper ticket (only a phone call to Moscow got her out, really). She often averred that there were few Caribbean islands that she had not set foot on. And the memorable food on those trips: baklava in Istanbul, strawberries and cream on Ireland's Shannon River, high tea with scones in Australia, gelato with wafers in Sicily, and pizza marinara in Venice (how many generations old was that starter for the delectable dough?) Dorothy would remember her music. She enjoyed playing the piano, even taking lessons in her later years. Many a song got her humming and sometimes dancing. She loved dancing to a full live orchestra playing Chris De Burgh's "The Lady in Red." Barbra Streisand's "Memory" from Cats would bring tears to her eyes, while Murray McLauchlan's "Farmer's Song" brought back old times in Saskatchewan (where she actually attended a Murray concert). And Leonard Cohen, also a fave: she went beyond Cohen's darkness to, as Cohen would say, "the cracks that let the light in." Dorothy was ever the optimist. Dorothy would remember her time cooking up wonders in the kitchen. She had models in her mother and grandmother, Genevieve, accustomed to preparing large meals for those working on the farm. Inherited cookbooks and recipe clippings bolstered Dorothy's culinary creativity. Yes, sometimes she sampled a bit too much as she cooked, to the consternation of some observers, but the product was invariably amazing. Dorothy would remember her last few years at the Davis Long Term Care Centre in Bolton, where she experienced loving care thanks to the Peel Region's commitment to looking after seniors in need. She was able to eat gourmet meals, sing her songs, pursue her interests, be with friends and feel at home. Special thanks to Dr. Kristof; to nurses Bev, Michelle, Melodie, Jane, Sukhi, Roya, Kamaljit, Gurpreet, Sharndeep and Rajvir; to social workers and aides Michelle, Dionne, Sonya, Ching, Vidya, Paula, Rani, Gurdeep, Angie, Marie. Jenny, Nathaniel, Dante, Dalyce, Mila, Danielle and Poonan; and to administrators Fatima and Lennie. What a superlative staff! Dorothy would remember a full and rewarding life. Anyone who knew her would not forget her vitality, humanity and goodness. She would not "rage, rage against the dying of the light." Rather, the words of Shakespeare come to mind:"Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince[ss],And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!"Dorothy, without doubt, now deservedly walks with the Lord. The family will receive their friends at the Egan Funeral Home, 203 Queen Street S. (Hwy. 50), Bolton (905-857-2213) Tuesday 5-8 o'clock. Funeral Mass will be held in Holy Family Roman Catholic Church, 60 Allan Drive, Bolton on Wednesday morning, July 5, 2023 at 11 o'clock. Followed by cremation.

She was predeceased by her beloved mother Mary Markle, and dear father John Edwin "Eddie" Markle of Gardenton, Manitoba and Sturgeon Falls, Ontario respectively. She is survived by her cherished daughter, Alethea Cassano, (and by Alethea's father, Paul Cassano, of Toronto, Ontario) and by her much-adored grand-daughter Grace Connolly, both of Windsor, Ontario. Also, by her dear brother Brian Markle and beloved wife Jeannette, (nee McDonald) of Toronto, Ontario and by their children Tristan (with partner Anya Shvets) and Ariana Markle.At the centre of Colleen's life was her family. Her mission as a daughter, as a mother and as a grandmother was always to love, to worry and to protect. And of course to feed. An inveterate foodie, an accomplished cook, and a voracious reader, she once worked her way effortlessly through the entirety of Julia Child's classic french cookbook. She had cultured tastes and was ever on the lookout for the best places to have a meal. In fact, you could travel to a city where she herself had never been and she would still give you strict instructions as to where you should go eat.Colleen was a self-possessed, elegant and fashionable woman who lacked pretense, followed her own judgment and never the crowd. A modern woman before her time, she completed graduate studies at a time when few women were doing so. She was liberal, witty, whimsical, and delightfully impractical.Colleen taught as an elementary French teacher, as an ESL instructor at St. Clair College, as a high school English teacher, and as an English professor at the University of Windsor, where she also worked as a Research Associate. There she expertly edited manuscripts long before they became publications, providing expertise and encouragement to many of her colleagues in the English department, some of whom became good friends, among them, the late great Alistair MacLeod.Still, some of Colleen's fondest memories were of teaching newcomers to Canada at St. Clair College. She recounted fondly one story of a student from Mexico who, upon looking out the window and seeing snow for the first time, ran outside, arms to the heavens, tongue to the skies.Colleen herself was a beautiful writer (as evidenced by her Master's thesis), was a lover of literature, of poetry, of music, specifically of Paul McCartney, of the White Whale, and, as it turns out, had a real predilection for pickles.The family owes a deep debt of gratitude to the Village at St. Clair. It really does take a village to navigate this kind of illness, and her "family" there really came through, caring for her beautifully, and providing her with endless activities to keep boredom at bay (thank you Alex) and allowing her to flourish one final time. Thank you to Irene for her friendship the last several months. The family would also like to thank the many wonderful nurses we encountered along the way. They are the ones who stitch together the broken fabric of our hospital system and who hold it together with their care and empathy.Finally, everyone should be lucky enough to have one true friend who would be there for them every day, come rain or shine. Colleen was that lucky and everyone who knows Susan Nadeau strongly suspects that she is an angel in disguise.We will be meeting under the clock, as soon as obligations allow, at the Royal York hotel in Toronto, as per Colleen's wish, to share our memories and to have a glass of prosecco and a lobster sandwich.

She returned to Vimy with daughters Beth and Connie to attend the 100th Anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, April 9, 2017. These two trips were major highlights in Iris' life.Iris grew up on the Detroit River across from Peche Island. Living on the Detroit River and Lake St Clair brought a special joy to her to life. She was a strong swimmer, enjoyed boating, had an adventurous spirit and took up water skiing at age 41, and she also had a love of the Arts. She passed her love of these sports activities and the Arts to her children. Her fond memories include lifeguarding for the Girl Guides at Dr Guest's property at Goose Bay on Riverside Drive and at Camlachie, north of Sarnia.Volunteering was also a big part of her life; giving back to the community. She was a volunteer at Metropolitan Hospital for over 30 years; the Canadian Cancer Society's patient support for 35 years; the Canadian Blood Services for 40 years; with her husband Jim, helped to support the Optimist Band; Friends of Wiilistead; and strongly supported the School of Music at the University of Windsor and the Windsor Classic Choral.

His loving and kind heart failed him during his happiest time - completely elated and content with life along with his hopes and dreams for the future with his wife Jelena (Sarapa) and daughter Danijela.Steven was born on December 9, 1967 to the most loving parents Sylvia (Vukanovich) and the late Dusan Jelich in Windsor, Ontario. When his father passed away suddenly at the age of 54, Steven held strong and affectionately took care of his mother and his two younger brothers... becoming the father figure to them as well. He often teased his mother, which he tended to do with people that he loved. She teased right back, chuckled and would often say "Oh Steven, stop it!" Steven loved his mother with every bit of his heart and would often recall the special memories he had of his father and mother growing up.Steven was the oldest and best big brother to Andrew (Mara) and David (Mira); sister-in-law Nada Tremblay (Donovan); brother-in-law Milan Sarapa (Deanna). The bond he had with his brothers Andrew and David along with his cousin Adam was unbreakable. Daily chats teasing each other with Steven often being the biggest offender. They loved each other wholeheartedly. When he visited Windsor, he would often stay with his younger brother David and family where his mom also resided. He enjoyed that special time with his brother, each taking a sofa and watching their favourite movies, particularly James Bond. Whereas visits with his brother Andrew were always in anticipation of finding a way to receive one of Andrew's famous massages. The three brothers had a very special bond, never having to use words - there was an unspoken love that was always there and interpreted.Steven deeply respected his father and mother-in-law, Dmitar and Milica Sarapa as they were a source of love, support, and guidance to him as a husband and father. His father-in-law loved when Steve was the apprentice on many home projects, teaching him how to build a fence, do small jobs around the house, and how to perfect his game in UNO. His mother-in-law who he affectionately called "Ma" always ensured that he was properly fed (her lasagna was his favourite), and she would often comment on how handsome he looked.The love he had for his nieces and nephews was tremendous. His affection and humour was always there for Maja, Ana, Mila, Dmitri, Donovan, Dejan and Mileja. Just recently, he dressed up as a Leprechaun for his youngest niece Mileja, which brought her the biggest smile - that was Steve.Steven will be sadly missed by many relatives - including aunts, uncles, cousins, and Kumovi and many friends with strong friendships made over the years.Steven was born and raised in Windsor, moving to North Bay and then London over the past several years. He was known as a family man - family always came first. He radiated with his exaggerated expressions of stories he told about his family, which always brought a twinkle to his eye.After graduating from Massey High School, he received his Honours Bachelor Comm from the University of Windsor, and his MBA from  Wayne State University. Steven began his 27- year career at Union Gas (Enbridge Gas Inc.) in 1995, working in many parts of the organization, progressing to more senior leadership roles including Director South West Operations and most recently as Director Contract Market Harmonization Program. He committed to numerous extracurricular activities supporting the company's community programs including active roles as the United Way Vice-Chair and Chair 2014 and 2015, First Robotics contest Judge, and Director of the Board of the Windsor-Essex Regional Chamber of Commerce, and Chair of the Advocacy Committee. Steven was well-respected for his collaborative and professional style and made a significant impact on people with his great ability to build strong relationships over his career. His unique sense of humour and ability to make people smile will be missed by many.As an active member of the Windsor-Essex Serbian community, he met his beautiful wife and true love Jelena (Sarapa) and wed on September 23, 2000, and became a very proud Tata, welcoming his precious Zlato, Danijela on April 19, 2003.

He enjoyed many years there raising his family, furthering his career in Provincial Government Labour Relations, enjoying the outdoors, and playing basketball and hockey. When life circumstances afforded the family the opportunity to migrate across the southern border, he continued to follow his heart to the warm sunshine, and landscapes of the American Southwest and settled in Phoenix, Arizona.

He was also a great storyteller and keeper of some Deneau family history.Dave retired from the City of Phoenix after a distinguished career as an Equal Opportunity Investigator and cherished the extra time that he was able to spend with his family. He enjoyed regular trips back to his hometown, the waters of the Pacific Ocean, and the annual get-togethers in Grand Bend. There was always time for friends and family and for that we are forever grateful.He will be sorely missed. But we're all taking the time to reflect on a life well lived.

At one point he managed the university residence library, while he studied full time and completed a fellowship in a local elementary school.Returning to his adopted country of Canada in 1973, Richard worked at the University of Western Ontario before moving to the Atlantic Institute of Education in Halifax.

He consulted extensively for the Canadian government, merging his academic studies with his innate practicality.  His travels took him to Chile, Botswana, Thailand, India, and Australia  where he examined communication strategies in rural areas.At Windsor, Richard was known as a professor who loved to teach and dedicated time to his students with compassion and understanding.

Lovingly remembered also by her sister Carol Gartshore, niece Karen, and nephews Jim and David.Born Shirley Jean Newell on August 29, 1934 to parents Cyril and Marjorie Newell (nee Creasor) in Timmins, Ontario, Jean's early years were filled with her close-knit family and adventures with dear friends Mary and Ann, with whom she stayed connected throughout her life and named her youngest daughter after.Jean's passion for music and piano began early.

A gracious host, their parties were legendary, with Jean playing her beloved grand piano as guests gathered around singing everything from hymns, to Gilbert and Sullivan, to rugby songs with cigar smoke and Canadian Club a-plenty. A friend to many, Jean was a caring and engaging conversationalist. A loving mother, Jean encouraged her four children in their every interest and spent hours driving to practices, lessons and school activities (although not always on time!). She instilled in them her love of the outdoors and the North through regular family outings like skating at Point Pelee,  sending all of her brood  to summer camp, and family holidays at their cottage in Muskoka.Marrying her love of music and history with civic engagement, Jean was a leader, volunteer and supporter of countless local events and organizations including the Windsor Symphony, the Windsor Architectural Conservancy Advisory Committee, the University of Windsor Faculty of Music and UNI-COM. Jean was active in Windsor's arts community, singing in choirs and enjoying the camaraderie of her many artist friends. In her later years, her creative outlets expanded to sewing beautiful home fashions which she sold in Windsor art shows and each summer at "The Summertime Shop" in her little blue house in Port Sydney.In her final years, Jean moved to Toronto to be cared for by family, with Windsor remaining dear in her heart.

Cheri was born in Windsor, Ontario, to Bernard and Colleen (Walter) Gignac on November 29, 1970. She grew up in Lasalle with her siblings, Allen and Amy, amidst a multitude of cousins, friends, and animals. Perhaps it was this endless and ever-changing menagerie of little beasts, both tame and wild, that sparked Cheri's joy of children, and a life-long passion for teaching. It was on a blind date while studying at the University of Windsor that Cheri met Dave, the love of her life. They married, finished school, and moved to Hunstville, where they would begin their lives together as a family and eventually, raise three beautiful children. Noah, Sarah, and Sophia were Cheri's pride and joy, and their kindness, sensitivity, humour, and compassion are a testament to the kind of person that Cheri was.Along with her three children and her beloved nephews, Tristan and Trey, Cheri leaves behind the hundreds of students that she taught at St. Mary Catholic School for nearly 20 years. She lived a life of service - to her family, her school, her church, and her community. She was the "go-to" person for many a teacher, principal, and friend - the person who could always be counted on to get things done. She founded St. Mary's Robotics Team, and volunteered to help mentor Hunstville High School's Robotics Team, who in 2022, won the provincial championship. She was an active member of St. Mary of the Assumption Church, where she coordinated the altar servers, prepared the children for First Communion, and led the Children's Liturgy. Music has always been one of Cheri's passions, and she loved to sing with the church choir or to accompany them on her flute.There are some who spend their entire lives trying to find their purpose. Cheri was blessed to have found hers, and to have lived it fully until the end. Her life was one of simple pleasures. She enjoyed kayaking, canoeing, hiking, camping, and cross-country skiing. She saw the beauty of nature around her, and the beauty of those whom she touched and cherished.Cheri is survived by her husband David, and their children Noah, Sarah, and Sophia. She leaves behind her parents Colleen and Bernie, her siblings Allen and Amy, and her in-laws Ken, Michael, and Chloe. She is dearly missed by her nephews Tristan, Trey, and Dylan.A visitation was held on Thursday, January 26, 2023 at Billingsley Funeral Home from 2-4 p.m. and 6-8 p.m. The funeral mass was held at St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church on Friday, January 27, 2023 at 11 a.m.  As an expression of sympathy memorial donations can be made to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul (Huntsville) or the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.

Adored mother of Michael and Talise and cherished daughter of Shirley Thomas, Laura will be dearly missed by her brother James Thomas, countless friends, and extended family members living around the world.

Her adventurous spirit - balanced by her unwavering focus and sharp intellect - brought Laura to the United States to establish an engineering firm, which continues to reflect her pursuit of excellence. Outside of her professional pursuits, Laura's personal interests and talents were extensive: she had a strong aptitude for language learning, enjoyed playing the piano and singing, and had a contagious appreciation for music and culture. While we wish we had more time in her electric presence, we take comfort in knowing Laura is now reunited with her late father, Bill Thomas. We can all live out her legacy by optimistically working towards a better tomorrow, engaging in our own pursuits of lifelong learning, and loving one another unconditionally.		t	NULL	NULL	42.3	-83.03

Susy was a wonderful mother to her cat, KitKat, who accompanied her from Ottawa to Kitchener, and back home to Windsor. Susy was fortunate to have had loving family spread throughout Michigan and Italy.Susan was a lifelong public servant, always seeking the opportunity to serve both locally and nationally. A proud graduate from the University of Windsor with a Master's degree in Political Science, Susan was eager to serve Canada alongside the best and the brightest in Ottawa. She quickly achieved career success with the federal government, relocating to Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa and Kitchener-Waterloo. It was in Ottawa at Indian and Northern Affairs Canada and the Privy Council Office where coworkers became family - a trend that continued throughout her career.Susy's passion for women in leadership inspired her strong work ethic and her dedication to public service. Little did she know, she herself was a woman in leadership as executive director at the Institute for Border Logistics and Security (IBLS) for Invest Windsor-Essex, her favourite role of a long and storied career. Her pride was reflected in all of her work in championing electric and connected vehicles to recognize Windsor as the auto-mobility capital of Canada. It was just another day in the office when Susy was told that she was an inspiration to her coworkers. At IBLS, Susy fulfilled her goal of serving her community and she was forever thankful for this opportunity. Through her strong efforts, she gave Canadians and her fellow Windsorites a better future, offering everything she had. Her strength and resilience extended past the walls of her office onto the volleyball and tennis courts. Susy loved to cycle and travel - she treasured adventure and was always eager to embrace other cultures, but nothing could compare to her admiration for the architecture of Siena, Italy.

(Gerry)Gerald J. Chevalier passed away at his home on Wednesday, October 12, 2022. He was a proud Canadian, having lived all of his 94 years in Southern Ontario. Gerald, or "Gerry", to most, was born in 1928 in Windsor to Juliette (née Marcotte) and Raymond Chevalier. He had five siblings: Rita Lavoie (Leo), Edward, Vincent, Bernard (Ardis, née Brandie) and Teresa Deane (Bart). He spoke fondly of his childhood.Gerry attended Assumption College and earned his degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Detroit, and his MBA from the University of Windsor. He met his wife, Eva (née Beaune), through their Catholic youth group, and they were married in 1952 and were blessed to spend 42 loving years together before Eva's sudden death in 1994. Together, they raised two children, Raymond (Linda, née Bulmer) of Sarnia and Catherine (David Burnie) of Kalamazoo, MI.In addition to his two children, Gerry is survived by his granddaughter Victoria Burnie of Salem, OR, his grandson, Alan Burnie (Kate) of Raleigh, NC, and his two great-grandsons Daniel (5) and Beau (3), both of Raleigh, NC.Gerry will be remembered first and foremost as a father, brother, grandfather, and friend. He was a generous listener and a very patient, gentle soul who was the epitome of kindness. His problem solving ability was unmatched, as was his devotion to the engineering trade. When he was first employed as a draftsman, he adopted short-sleeve shirts so that his sleeves did not smudge his work. Eventually, while still wearing his trademark short-sleeve dress shirts  and quintessential pocket-protector to hold his mechanical pencils  Gerry founded and ran his own engineering firm, Chevalier Engineering. Many of his projects can still be found throughout Essex County and beyond today.After a short retirement in his seventies, Gerry returned to work and continued into his early 80s. During every phase of retirement, Gerry could be found doing puzzles, listening to his extensive collection of jazz, opera, big band, and classical music, and upcycling cardboard cereal boxes into realistic models of buildings and moveable models of heavy machinery, with occasional straws thrown in to serve as hydraulics.Gerry, who was never in much of a hurry, enjoyed a nice drive in the country or to view new and upcoming construction projects, and every sweet dessert ever made. As a child of the Great Depression  and engineer  he was always looking to reuse and repurpose just about anything he could. He had many treasures (records, punch-card computers, slide rules, tools, etc.). A true gentleman, he was almost never without his trademark hat, unless he was wearing a hardhat.Visitation for Gerry will be held on Monday, October 17, 2022 from 6-8 p.m. and Tuesday, October 18, 2022 from 11 a.m. until time of service at 11:30 a.m. at Families First, East Windsor, 1065 Lauzon Rd.

Did someone say car enthusiast? Holy cannoli!! What a passion he had for cars, especially those in the sporty, classic Italian genre. He would happily and fashionably drive family and friends to their destinations for special occasions, or take them cruising around town with the top down while putting pedal to the metal just for the fun of it. He especially loved cruising with Alana by his side.Deeply proud of his Italian heritage, Elio was a long-standing member of the Ciociaro Club of Windsor and was the accordionist for the Ciociaro Club folklore group. In his younger years he was the keyboard player in the Italian band 'Figli Del Sol' and had a wonderful time giving performances at wedding receptions and summer festival venues.

Had her body been willing, she would have travelled the world.  She always said that in a past life she lived on a tropical island where she would never have to wear shoes, where warm breezes would carry the scent of exotic flowers and where her body would always be warm. Anne was an avid reader, proudly learning to manage her nook and playbook libraries on her tablet. She loved nothing better than sitting out on her patio with her daughter Laurie and family, quietly reading, enjoying the garden, birds and the endless stream of boats passing by on the 'crick'. She was devoted fan of her grandchildren, cheering them on as they participated in sports, music, and school activities. Friends were important to her. She stayed in touch with her old neighbourhood and card groups, the 'widow and widowers' group as well as the University of Windsor Lunch Bunch and for more than 80 years with her own kindergarten friends. She loved to dance, listen to music, and enjoyed a good hearty laugh. Anne was a member of the Senior centre and Harbour Lights choirs. She happily danced with the Windsor Singles and the Tuesday group at Lincoln United Church. She taught kindergarten for the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School board, working to make learning fun and taking great pride in the accomplishments of her students.

[not] only the special love one has for one's partner, important as it is; I include love of family and close friends...it is rather loving them than being loved by them, ... that brings happiness"Joan lived every moment of her 98 years with enthusiasm, curiosity and generosity. A progressive thinker and world traveller she saw the good in all people. The many charities she supported made lives better for children around the world, strengthened social justice, and equality for women, and 2SLGBQTi+ people.Born October 8, 1923, in Melbourne Australia, "the traveling twins" Joan and Anne, aged 3 months, sailed by steamship to England where they spent their happy childhood. Years later as a mother, Joan dedicated herself to giving her own children the security and love that she firmly believed prepared her to weather all life's storms. When Claude Dobson, her father, died in 1940, her intrepid mother, Polly brought the twins to Canada by ship, during the height of the Battle of the Atlantic. As soon as they could, Joan, Anne and Polly enlisted in the Women's Royal Canadian Navy Service ("the Wrens") to do their part in supporting the war effort. After the war Joan became secretary to the Canadian Consul in Brussels where she and Val, an unlikely couple, met on a spur of the moment blind date. He was older, an academic, introverted, often pessimistic but persuasive and charming. Joan was young, beautiful, spontaneous and effortlessly attractive. They fell deeply in love, married and began their adventurous and tumultuous fifty-four years together. They moved to Montreal in 1950 where Cathy, their first child, was born. Following Val's jobs they moved to Toronto, where Andrew was born, and then to rural Essex County in 1961, when Val became a professor at the University of Windsor and Maggie was born. Joan volunteered for years with the NDP, was always there when her children came home from school, made many friends, and travelled with Val to France, Switzerland, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Japan, Spain and of course the UK to see Anne and her family. They were actively involved in University life attending and hosting many parties. When Val retired they moved back to Toronto, continued traveling, formed new, enduring friendships, played tennis and bridge, Joan served as secretary to the Condominium Board and they welcomed grandchildren into their lives. When Val died in 2004 Joan stayed in their condo, walked every day, read many books, did countless crosswords, cared for grandchildren and kept up her active social life. Joan lived independently until 2021 when her health and memory began to decline and she moved to Chartwell Waterford retirement residence.Throughout her life, Joan made friends everywhere and was universally loved for her generous spirit, wide-ranging knowledge, brilliant conversation and outgoing personality. A gourmet cook, she hosted friends and family with wine and delicious food, well into her 90s With Val, she raised Cathy, Andrew and Maggie with a firm and loving hand, imparting life skills and values they cherish to this day. She knew countless poems by heart and would recite all 70 stanzas (589 lines) of Horatius at the Bridge to entertain her children on road trips. She adored her grandchildren and great grandchildren and was active and helpful in their upbringing, often rescuing sleep-deprived parents.Joan was pre-deceased by Claude Congreve Dobson (father), Edith (Polly) Dobson (mother), Vladimir Cervin (husband), Anne Patterson (twin). She is survived by her children: Catherine (the late David Gass), Andrew (MaryAnn), Maggie (Dave), her grandchildren Andrea, Daniel, Zander, Tom, and her great-grandchildren Jason, Keira, Jessica, Gemma and Zola Joan. Joan's family circle includes Gerry Brosky (father of Zander and Tom), and David Gass' children Heather (Lisa), Susan (Craig) and Ian and her dear friends Gwen, Bob, Brenda, Grace and Frank.The family send heartfelt thanks for the excellent, compassionate and professional care Joan received from the staff of the Chartwell Waterford Retirement Residence in Oakville Ontario, and the Personal Support Workers from Home Care Assistance and Paramed. We want to particularly thank Dr. Issam Obeid, Sylvia, Debrienne, Abbie, Pama, Cherina, Rose, Cherry, Sandra, Joy, Angele, Mira, Neethu and Vivian. With help from the family, these amazing, kind workers made her last days comfortable and peaceful.And last words from Joan " [A] quick word to the young ones - don't ever think, as one does in youth (I certainly did) - that nothing will matter by the time you are thirty (or whatever) because by then you won't care. I assure you, you go on caring and, with luck, enjoying life right through it."A service in celebration of Joan's life will be held Wednesday, July 6 at 1:00 p.m. at Turner and Porter Yorke Chapel 2357 Bloor St W, Toronto (Bloor and Windermere). All friends and family are welcome.

Predeceased by spouses Michael Zin (1928-2006) and Stanley Chant (1920-1979) and her brother Sandy (Joan) Craigmyle, Phyllis is survived by her sons, Andrew (Mary) and Peter (Kathy) Chant, by six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, and by the children and grandchildren of Michael's siblings in the Zin and Semeniuk families of Windsor and Amherstburg. Phyllis lived a long and adventurous life. Born in Montreal, she attended Strathcona Academy, where her 1940 yearbook described her as "Smiles and Chuckles". She married Stanley in 1944 and spent the miserable winter of 1944-45 in Halifax while pregnant and Stanley was at sea in the Navy. In June 1945 the Craigmyle and Chant families moved to Windsor where her father, Andrew Craigmyle, owned the Viking Pump Company, a business still in operation on Grove Avenue. This business and Phyllis's family flourished, marked by the arrival of Andrew and Peter, although unfortunately her marriage to Stanley did not survive. While working for Viking as secretary-treasurer, Phyllis enrolled in an accounting course at Assumption University, taught by a newly minted Ph.D. in accounting, Michael Zin. In Phyllis' words, she failed the course but succeeded in marrying the professor. Phyllis and Michael lived a very active life in the Windsor community, particularly during Michael's tenure as Dean of the School of Business at the University of Windsor. Phyllis and Michael were an energetic team actively involved in many Windsor organizations, including Rotary, Goodwill Industries, the CAA, and Essex Golf Club. Phyllis was a devoted member of the congregation at Sandwich (now Bedford) United Church on Sandwich Avenue, and never let her family's success turn her head from that humble parish. But wherever she went, she went with style. Following Michael's passing in 2006, Phyllis lived for a while in their grand house on the river in Amherstburg, and was only reluctantly corralled into a retirement residence, which struggled to contain her energy. With the help of a great crew of "Zingirls", Phyllis remained the bright, active, and alert woman she had always been until her body failed to keep up with her spirit, which left us for a higher ground early on New Year's Day. She will be missed by all whose lives she touched. This includes the devoted Zingirls - Charlene, Cynthia , Brandi, Gisele, and Mel - who made her days in residence unconditionally joyful; her children and grandchildren, on whom she left an indelible legacy of energy and intelligence; and on the Windsor organizations who felt the presence of the Phyllis and Michael team. Donations in Phyllis' memory can be made to the Salvation Army, or to any charity of choice, as Phyllis would support any good cause. A private funeral will be held in Windsor. A celebration of her life will be held this summer when we have defeated COVID and suitably glorious weather has returned.

She was a proud defender of her Scottish heritage through her mother Edith Smith (nee Willock) and she was keen to emphasize the common Celtic heritage of both Scotland and France which she also loved. She was an exceptional presence as a mother, with wonderful excursions teaching us to draw and identify wildflowers, graciously decorating the house in the patterns and spirit of William Morris ("have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful") and even choosing a living room upholstery fashioned after the Bayeux tapestry to give us a sense of deeper cultural roots and history. . She loved nurturing her grandchildren's sense of fun and curiosity. She enjoyed travel but also loved the comfort of fellowship and love in the summer community of Llewellyn Beach on St. Joseph Island, Ontario. A service commemorating her life and goodness will be held at the chapel at Llewellyn Beach at a future date to be determined.She will be dearly missed by her children Fred (Cappy), Elizabeth (Andrew), Paul and Rebecca (Ronnie), as well as by her seven grandchildren, Geoffrey, Caroline, Rebecca (Brendan), George, Richard, Jamie and Gabriel.

He is survived by his wife of 31 years and best friend, Virginia (nee Moore), his son William (Bill) (Kareen Colbert), daughter Shelly Loeppky, granddaughter Lorissa Luhmann and her family, along with his sister Mary Hallewick (late Ed Hallewick) and nieces Eden Hansen and Elise Hallewick. He was step-father to Jennifer Conely (Ray Dickson), and was incredibly proud to be godfather to Don Douglas. Cal grew up from humble beginnings on George Avenue in Windsor. He was a terrific athlete: a fastball pitcher for the Chrysler UAW Team; an AKO Fratmen football player; and an outstanding Walkerville Collegiate basketball player and soccer goalie.  In 1952 he earned Windsor All City Honours in Basketball. Cal was an avid sports fan and a die hard Montreal Canadiens supporter. Later in life he made his mark in sports as a road hockey goalie, proclaiming himself "Mr. Zero". He was a proud graduate of the University of Windsor, earning his degree at night school while pursuing and advancing his career. Cal had a long career at Chrysler Canada, holding various positions which settled him in numerous locations across Canada including Windsor, Brandon, Regina, Winnipeg, Moncton and Mississauga. He retired after more than 37 years as a Marketing Executive from Chrysler's Mississauga office, before returning to the Windsor area in retirement where many lifelong friends resided. Not one to sit idle for long ... after retiring, Cal became a Court Clerk in the court houses of both Brampton and Windsor which provided the background for many stories in the years that followed. He and Virginia spent more than 20 happy winters at The Gardens in Seminole, Florida and enjoyed golf, the beach, the sunshine and warmth, shuffleboard, sitting poolside and their many snowbird neighbours from across North America. More recently, Cal spent quality time with his dinner group, the gang at Tim Horton's, and treasured moments with Arnold at the track trying to convert his $20 budget into a big win. Cal had a wonderful sense of humour, and was always focused on adding fun to any gathering. He was quick to laugh and full of snappy repertoire and wit. Cal was a loving father to Bill and the two had a very special bond. They shared many adventures throughout the years, often including time on the golf course with special friends. Bill regularly recites "Big Cal" stories that evidence the sheer enjoyment of a life really well lived. After any good restaurant meal, Bill was always ready for Cal's comment to the server  - "My compliments to the chef, my regrets to the cashier". As per Cal's wishes, cremation has taken place and a private family inurnment service will be held. In lieu of flowers, if you wish to make a donation in Cal's memory, we ask that you consider making it to Diabetes Canada or the Canadian Cancer Society.

Beloved husband of Lenore Woodside (nee Banks) for 43 years. Cherished father of Dean Woodside of Toronto and Lindsay Woodside (Culum Canally) of Toronto. Son of the late Harry and Catherine Woodside of Windsor. Loving brother of Catherine Browning (Gordon) of Windsor. Son in-law of the late Francis and Bernice Banks and brother-in law of the late Marilyn Banks all of Toronto. Loved by his niece, nephews, aunts, uncles and cousins. Adored by his legions of friends who grew up alongside him in South Windsor during the formidable years of 1960s. Born in Windsor on October 20, 1951, Bill spent his teenage years working at the local A&P grocery store and being fascinated with electronics. After graduating from St. Clair College (1973) where he studied Electrical/Electronics Engineering technology and the University of Windsor (1976), job opportunities called him North. There he continued working for A&P in both Midland and Orillia in managerial roles and subsequently was the inventory specialist at The West Bend Cookware Company in Barrie. By the early 1980s, Bill's entrepreneurial drive and early interest in the personal computer saw him start his own business, W.J. Woodside & Associates Ltd., operating out of Peter Street in Orillia where he lived for over 30 years in the community raising his family, while also volunteering for the Kinsmen Club and as a Scout and Youth Group leader at St Paul's United Church. Needless to say, the internet arrived early at the Woodside household and by the mid-90s an open phone line became a thing of the past. After selling his business, Bill put his Geography degree to work and spent time at the Simcoe County District School Board working in the field of transportation geography. Later years, saw Bill continue his business acumen when he started LeisureScapes hot tub and landscaping business, in Barrie. His children were incredibly lucky to have a dad who often worked from home-this meant school lunch hours spent watching "Leave it to Beaver" instead of in the lunchroom and having a loving father to guide and mentor them while they enjoyed a childhood with all the glory of "boiled hot dogs!" An original "Mr. Fix It" - Bill always jumped at the chance to pull something apart and reassemble it; even better than he found it. He took immense pleasure in reading assembly instructions and user manuals. The family home still uses the 1978 Maytag washer and dryer and General Electric stove he and Lenore purchased upon marrying. A walking encyclopedia, Bill's vast knowledge on just about everything from science to history to world issues amazed his family every day. A baby boomer through and through, his kids consider him an ideal man of his generation, who believed that if you did a good job and followed the game of life that should be enough. His kindness was exemplified in the unsolicited things he did for many people. Bill enjoyed his retirement years with Lenore by spending days on his boats in Georgian Bay, catching the sunny rays while mowing the lawn, cooking up delicious meals on his beloved 1970s orange kettle BBQ, or cruising the roadways in his cars. Bill loved the open road and could name the make and model of any car. Bill attended the Wyevale United Church, where he was a Board Member and volunteered to host church dinners. He also adored getting to know his children as adults and celebrating their successes - they were his pride and joy. He was Lenore's biggest cheerleader and he the love of her life. He never let an opportunity pass to let his family know that he loved them. He will be forever missed. A private funeral service will be held in the family home on December 18. Bill loved his golden retriever's.

He is survived by his wife Joyce Elizabeth (Bowes), daughter Lea (Tim Salayka), daughter Stacey Ray, and Stuart Lynne (Donna), as well as his grandchildren Reid and Cole (Seguin), Carmen and Dane (Salayka), and extended grandchildren Katie and Ryan (Tatiana Pejkovic). He will also be missed by his sisters Dr. Marilyn Ray, Patricia Kirk (Douglas Hunter), Mary Ellen Berry (Ken), Catherine Therrien (Paul), Loretta Ray and many nieces and nephews.From an early age, Michael was driven to a deeper understanding of socio-economic issues, with a view to raising the discussion of equality and justice for all members of society. This led to a lifetime of learning and dedication to the cause. He graduated from the University of Western Ontario, with a B.A. (Hons) in Economics and Political Science.  He received a teaching degree from the Ontario College of Education, a law degree from the University of Windsor Law School and was called to the Ontario Bar in 1973.He worked as a lawyer and was Director of clinical law at the Faculty of Law, Legal Assistance Program of the University of Windsor. Michael was instrumental in developing the curriculum for clinical law students and was proud of the impact his passion for 'fair representation for all' had on his law students.  His ambition and persistence helped change the practice to allow legal students more access to clinical experience in all court rooms.In 1980, Michael was elected to the Windsor City Council where he served as an alderman until 1987. He was elected as a Member of the 34th Provincial Parliament (Ontario), where he proudly served his constituents from 1987 to 1990.After his career in politics, he returned to practicing law and acted as the lead regional counsel for the Support and Custody Legal Services Branch of the Ministry of the Attorney General. Michael had been a member of various community, city, provincial and federal agencies. He proudly served on many boards, commissions and committees - too many to list.  However, some notable appointments include: Windsor Regional Hospital (former chairman), Windsor-Essex Development Commission, Windsor Police Services Board, Windsor Port Authority, and the YQG Airport Board.While in the hospital, Michael often remarked about the professional compassion displayed by the nurses, doctors and staff.  He was reassured that part of his life's work came to fruition with the ongoing efforts to provide quality care to the patients at WRH. Beyond his forthright manner and diligent quest for justice, he taught us all that doing the right thing was not always popular, but was the necessary path. Compassion was the basis of his morality and his impassioned stories, whether anecdotal or serious, will be missed.

Spellman died on June 25 in Ontario, Canada. He was born in Tewksbury, MA. A highly accomplished scholar, he was a Fellow of The Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland (RAS), for scholarship relating to Asian culture and society of the highest level. He retired as Head of the Department of Asian Studies, University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada in 2000.Dr. Spellman is considered one of the world's foremost scholars on Asian Studies and a cultural expert on the political history of India. Spellman studied the history and civilization of India at the Sorbonne, University of Oxford, and the University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies under Arthur Llewellyn Basham, a noted historian, Indologist and author, where he received both his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees.Praised for his "remarkably original and penetrating mind," his outspoken and dogmatic nature, affectionate sense of humor, charm and dedication to students, Spellman spoke three Indian languages, lectured world-wide and authored books and dozens of articles on ancient India, its people, politics, and culture. He loved independence and freedom, and was an ardent fighter for human rights, social justice and environmental protection. He treasured kindness, scholarship, debate, the pursuit of excellence, gardening, and his students, friends, family and academic colleagues across the world.Spellman grew up in the Boston area, and attended Oliver Ames High School in Easton, serving as Class Secretary, and was active in Debate Club, Student Senate and government affairs. Under the watchful eye of Louise A. Gilligan of Ashburnham, Massachusetts, who he met at 16, he attended Northeastern University in Boston with intentions to become an attorney. While there, he met Dr. Elmer H. Cutts, Professor of History and Government, and Chairman of the Department, who had a profound influence on him. Dr. Cutts ignited a spark in Spellman in Indology and helped him earn a Ford Foundation scholarship for Asian Studies. Professor Cutts wrote to an esteemed colleague, Professor Arthur Llewellyn Basham (1914-1986) at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, requesting he supervise John Spellman for his master's degree.In 1956, Spellman studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies, at the University of London. In 1961, Dr. Spellman was hired as History Professor at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. He married Margaret McGregor Thomson (1938-2016). The two met while he was a student in London, when he needed a typist to prepare his manuscripts. Later that year Spellman attended the University of Chicago to study Tamil and other South Indian languages. From 1962 to 1964, Spellman was Visiting Lecturer in Indian Politics, University of Kerala, India. Both of his children, Suzanne Bharati (1963) and John Gilligan (1964) were born at the Salvation Army's Catherine Booth Hospital, Nagercoil, Trivandrum.By 1964, Spellman's reputation as an important scholar in the field of Ancient Indian history was firmly established through his book, Political Theory of Ancient India; A Study of Kingship from the earliest times to circa A.D. 300, published by Oxford University Press. This original work still serves of great value to students of the history of political thought and government throughout the world.While in India, Spellman collected and translated village fables that he read to his children. In 1967, he published The Beautiful Blue Jay and Other Tales of India, with illustrator Jerry Pinkney and Little Brown (Boston). This book was published in many languages and heralded as one of the most important children's books on India.In 1967, Dr. Spellman was hired as assistant professor of History at the University of Washington in Seattle. He taught Asian Studies at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, was elected to the Board of Directors for the American Civil Liberties Union, and trained Peace Corps volunteers for programs in India.In 1967, he was recruited by Dr. J. F. Leddy, president of the University of Windsor, to head and create the Asian Studies Department. Dr. Leddy became a life-long friend and ardent supporter. Spellman spent the next 33 years there, teaching students and creating a strong academic team that included beloved Professor Dr. Mahesh Mehta (1969-1999) and his wife Vibhutiben and Professor Dr. Kalyan Kumar Sarkar (1970-1997) and his wife Juthika.Professor Spellman served as president of the Institute for Asian Cultures from 1975-2000. In 1979, he married Victoria Lewis. They divorced in 1981. Spellman founded the Indian Cultural Development Centre which was funded by the Ford Foundation and the Government of India, where he worked with over a million people in 400 villages in three South Indian states (Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka) to help each village become self-sufficient through their own indigenous resources.In the 1980's, Dr. John Spellman served as consultant and an expert witness on Sikhism to the human-rights commissions of Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario, as a consultant to the Canadian Ministry of Justice on issues relating to Sikhism, and gave expert testimony for several high-profile court cases (School Boards, Canada 3000 Airlines, American Airlines, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, etc.) in North America. Dr. Spellman was presented the Sikh American Heritage Award 1986 by the Sikh Council on Religion and Education (SCORE) at a ceremony on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.In 1986, Spellman served as a Visiting Scholar for the Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School, after its founder, Henry J. Steiner, visited him in India. This was a career highlight for Dr. Spellman, and he treasured his time with the Steiner's, beloved friend Holly Bull and his Harvard colleagues.In the 1990's and 2000's, He served as a consultant to the Immigration and Refugee Documentation Centre, Ottawa, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, Ontario Human Rights Commission, the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board and Amnesty International. He served as director of development projects and consultant to Asia for Canadian University Service Overseas, an international development organization that works to end poverty and inequality.All his life, Spellman enjoyed horticulture, organic gardening and being a farmer.

He took up the Friends of the Marshfield Woods case, and the Big Creek case. In 2013, Spellman was awarded the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Medal for his human rights, civil liberties, and volunteer work.John Spellman says he never meant to be controversial. He just always believed it is necessary to speak up and fight for justice.Dr. Spellman is survived by his children, Suzanne Bharati Spellman Hendery and Daryl Hendery of Reno, NV; John Gilligan Spellman of San Francisco, CA; and grandson Brian Andrew Hendery of Vancouver.Dr. Spellman was laid to rest at St. John the Baptist Cemetery in Amherstburg, Ontario.

Norm never forgot how his life started out. He always liked to have lots of packages to open at Christmas time, perhaps because his first Christmas present in Canada was a plastic cup. He learned English quickly, mostly in self-defense. Norm attended Patterson High School, followed by the University of Windsor, graduating with the Engineering Class of 1967 and earning his Ph.D. in 1970. He almost failed his first year because he was very busy learning to play Bridge, meeting girls, and tasting the fine Canadian beer. His life changed when he met Mary Ellen (nee Jurgeleit) from Detroit and within 2 weeks of meeting, they knew their future was a life together. They married in May 1967 and were truly blessed with daughter Laura in 1973 and son Kurt in 1974. Norm loved them dearly and the arrival of his granddaughter Elsa in 2005 gave him one more blessing to love. Norm is survived by his beloved wife Mary Ellen, sister-in-law Ericka Weisberg (Steve), daughter Laura (Shawn), son Kurt, granddaughter Elsa, cousin Marga (nee Somschor) Pattison and husband Clif, and their son Christopher (Mary), boys Owen and Eric. Also, by longtime family friend Elfriede Kreschner Andries. Norm loved being an Engineer. His hobby was Engineering, his interest was Engineering, his life was Engineering. Sometimes his wife reminded him that he had a wife and 2 children. Norm was certified to practice in Ontario, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Alberta and Saskatchewan. He worked throughout Canada as well as projects in Egypt, Nigeria, Yemen, Peru and China. He was Deputy Manager, MM Dillon Ltd.; Vice President Operations, Collavino Inc.; Founder of Becker Engineering Group; and President of N.K. Becker Inc. Norm was honored with numerous awards from his Profession, his University, his Province and his community. He was deeply passionate about helping immigrants, single parent families and feeding the less fortunate. A celebration of his very incredible life will happen once the pandemic allows it.

Alice, alongside countless female federal employees, was involved in protests where she fought for pay equity for women, resulting in the largest pay equity case win in Canadian history.Volunteer service was at the core of who Alice was and she was very involved in the community, from her days in Toronto as one of the key organizers of the first Caribana to her work as the past President of the Windsor Women Working with Immigrant Women, an organization she helped to found alongside the late Daphne Clarke.

She was a lover of literature and continued to write poetry and prose over the course of her life.  Alice was a member of the Writer's Ink and also hosted the Writer's Ink radio show on CJAM.Alice was forever the life of any party especially the many she threw, either for herself or for others.

Alice was also a devoted woman of God and attended St. Martin de Porres and Corpus Christi Catholic Church where she sometimes served as a eucharistic minister.Alice is survived by her most precious gift, her daughter Moira Griffin, whom she cherished dearly.  She also leaves behind her son-in-law Marshall Tyler whom she thought of as her own son.

He was born in Mar del Plata, province of Buenos Aires, Argentina.  He is survived by his wife Vivian Cattaneo (née Schachert), to whom he was a devoted husband for 53 years. Beloved father to son Ben (husband to Myra Cataquiz) and daughter Jessica (partner to Shiraz Vally), Julian was extremely proud of his children. Julian immigrated to Canada with his family in 1977. He felt honoured upon becoming a Canadian citizen in 1987. He attended the Belgrano Day School in Buenos Aires, where he made many lifelong friendships. Julian completed his PhD at the University of Michigan and joined the Faculty of Business Administration (now the Odette School of Business) of the University of Windsor in July 1980. A demanding but caring teacher, Julian taught International Management, Compensation and related courses. During his tenure at the University of Windsor, he held senior positions at the Odette School of Business and the University of Windsor, including Director of International Affairs and Vice-President of Research. He was instrumental in establishing the Executive MBA, Master of Management and one-year MBA for graduates in Business. He organised several international conferences including in Singapore, Santiago, Buenos Aires and Bratislava. He taught Human Resource Management at the Canadian Executive MBA at the Warsaw School of Economics. An avid reader of science fiction, science, politics, history, language and economics, Julian had a uniquely curious and critical mind and a gift for retaining an enormous amount of knowledge, which he was always happy to share. Julian was a Board Member for the Boy Scouts of Canada and the Unitarian Universalist Church of Olinda in Ruthven. He was a member of the St. Andrew's Society of the River Plate Pipes and Drums in Argentina, where he played the drums for several years.

Rick leaves behind his wife of 45 years, Maria, and children Josh (Amanda) and Kayle. Rick will be joining his father Lawrence and brother Mickey in Heaven.  He is survived by his mother Joyce and siblings Danny, Jimmy, and Patrick.  Rick was cherished by his nieces and nephews, Dom, Josh, Casey, Lauren, and Micaela.  He adored and created a lasting bond with the light of his life, his grandchildren, Finn, and Zoe.  He will never be forgotten.Rick was beloved within the college and the community for over two decades where he taught.  He gave so much to the students and the athletes at the college.  A dedicated and charismatic head coach of the St. Clair College Varsity men's basketball for over 13 years, Rick was also named St Clair College's Gerald Service Inter-Collegiate Coach of the year award winner in 1997-98.  He claimed two West Region titles in 2001-2002 and 2003-2004, but his greatest success was the 2005-2006 season where they won the bronze medal at the provincial championship.  Above all the success, he cared most about his players well-being and that is reflected in the friendships he still holds to this day.He has also developed so many friendships throughout the years as an athlete quarterbacking for the University of Windsor Lancers, playing touch football and bringing home the Division "A" provincial Championship for his slow pitch team, the Bowery Boys. But most importantly, he loved spending his time organizing the next golf trip, vacations or father and son outings.But to those who had the pleasure of knowing him outside of sports community in Windsor-Essex, they would all agree he was larger than life. To say he could really light up the room or turn up the dance floor would be an understatement. But his true passion was entertaining, hosting dinner parties, and traveling with dearest friends alongside his wife Maria.And even though his friendships were very important, he was most devoted to his soulmate Maria and his loving sons Josh and Kayle. Rick meant the world to them.  His kindness, care, love, friendship and humour are all qualities his family adored about him. Their hearts are broken after his fight with cancer over the past 4 years and his family does not think this feeling of emptiness will ever end, but they hope the memories of him will help fill that void over time.Former players and colleagues have already reached out to express their interest in creating a scholarship fund in his name for St. Clair College. Anyone interested in supporting this effort can reach out to the St. Clair Athletic Coordinator Ted Beale Ph: 519-563-8012 or email tbeale@stclaircollege.caDue to COVID restrictions funeral arrangements will be kept to family and close friends only but a celebration of life will be announced at a later date.

Dermot was diagnosed with cancer just four short months ago. After a month in hospital he returned to his downtown Toronto apartment to spend his remaining days with calm dignity. He died peacefully in his sleep.His life partner Debra lovingly cared for him and made his final days as comfortable as possible. We love you Deb - you are a saint.Dermot was just two years old when the Ganley family moved to Windsor, Ontario from Athlone, Ireland in 1956. He grew up in Windsor and settled in Toronto after living in Montreal for a couple of years. Dermot was an avid reader from a young age and exhausted the libraries at home, in High School and at the University of Windsor, where he studied English and Philosophy. He also exhausted many a prof in the English department at the U of W with his inquisitive mind and his "scary" knowledge of writers, poets, existentialists - both classic and modern. One would never question Dermot's references to Wilde, Joyce, Shakespeare, Yeats or Nietzsche.It was also at that time that Derm began his life-long love affair with music. Naturally he became fiercely knowledgeable about music and the musicians that made it. From Iggy Pop and Jimi Hendrix in the day to the performers of today - his musicology was, again, "scary".Dermot loved Toronto and was a denizen of the city's music venues, it's restaurants, movie theatres, museums and sundry cultural offerings. Downtown Toronto was his "turf" - north of Bloor Street was "nosebleed country", Etobicoke and Scarborough the "boonies". Dermot skated several times a week on downtown rinks right up until the end of last winter.Dermot decided at an early age he wasn't going to have children - recognizing his own free-spiritedness - and treated his many nieces and nephews as if they were his own children. "Uncle Dermo" became the de facto tourist guide to his siblings and nephews and nieces who visited from Windsor and to his "Irish" cousins visiting from Ireland.Dermot worked as a labourer at "the Soup" (Campbell's) for many years and as a custodian at a Toronto synagogue for several more years. But they were just jobs to help pay the rent and help facilitate his higher pursuits - knowledge and insight. He found ambition to be vain. He didn't put much stock in attaining fame or glory nor care too much about acquiring wealth.Dermot was a sensitive and somewhat rebellious youth - and never really changed his stripes. He was generous to a fault and would give one the shirt off his back - after he corrected one's sloppy use of grammar or a misquoted Bob Dylan lyric. He was a keen baseball aficionado and remained a Detroit Tigers fan for life. Detroit's old Tiger stadium held a special place in his heart.Dermot lived his life on his own terms. He most definitely did it "his way". Dermot, we'll see you sitting on that rainbow's end just round the bend our Huckleberry friend - legs crossed, calmly smoking a cigarette, drinking a glass of chardonnay and looking at us like we're late.Debra and the family would like to thank the staff at the palliative care unit at St. Michael's Hospital and at the Temmy Latner Centre for Palliative Care at Mt. Sinai Hospital.Dermot was predeceasd by his dad and mom Sean and Marion, brother Bernie and his wife Denise and his brother Patrick.He is survived by his brothers and sisters: Mike (Colleen), Sean (Mary Lou), Maura (Larry 2020), Ciaran (Rose), Deirdre (Doug), Jimmy (Joan), Cathleen (Greg), Brendan (Shelly), Colm, Alana (Elio), Emmett and Aileen (Chris). Dermot will be missed by a large contingent of nieces and nephews and great-nieces and nephews who loved their "Uncle Dermo" dearly, as well as cousins here and in Ireland. He will also be remembered by numerous friends both here in Windsor and in Toronto.Cremation has taken place. A celebration of Dermot's life will be held later.

Only child of father Chun Miao and mother Tse Kuei (nee) Shao. Loving mother of Dean Hsieh. After completing botany Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Taiwan, she further pursued higher education at the University of Windsor for another Master's in biology.  Motherhood ended this academic pursuit but did grow roots in Windsor leading to Canadian citizenship in 1977. During the 1980's, she was a tireless advocate for Chinese culture in her adopted community working for the Essex County Chinese Association and the International Chinese Canadian Benevolent Association on various cultural programs involving language, traditions, a proposed Chinatown project and the annual Carousel of Nations event. With her pen name "Ku Feng", art was a huge part of her life. She held multiple gallery exhibitions as well as displays at local public libraries. Art and the will to share Chinese culture led to teaching. Chinese painting was taught through the Windsor Board of Education adult learning as well as privately. During the 1990's, she also taught Mandarin and brought Tai Chi to the YMCA. She also expressed creativity through writing essays for the World Journal Chinese Daily News with (43) published essays. She also volunteered with the Grace Hospital Salvation Army Auxiliary Women's club. Alice was a pioneering champion for the Chinese community in Windsor as an educator, artist and writer. She was a caring and giving person who volunteered her time and wealth.  She was also a loving and nurturing mother.  Most of all, Alice was a kind and gentle soul always willing to spread the ideas of honesty, friendship and respect. A Private Family Service has taken place followed by cremation.

Mary was born in Toronto, the eldest of nine children. Her mother Anna emigrated from Sicily in 1925 to marry Antonino (Tony).Mary was an industrious, brilliant, talented, vivacious, caring optimist with a great sense of humour. Her frugality and resourcefulness were legendary. No job was too small or too big for her, ranging from knitting socks to replacing shingles on the roof of the house.In 1948 she married Frank DeMarco and moved to Windsor to join Frank who had begun his teaching career at Assumption University in 1946. Their first child was born in 1949, followed by 11 more, to make an even six girls and six boys (Maria DeMarco, Anna Moore (Jack), Jeanie DeMarco, Paula DeMarco, Chris DeMarco (Brian Riera), John DeMarco (Martha), Dan DeMarco (Kim), Tom DeMarco, Jim DeMarco, Terry DeMarco (Fraser Godfrey), Robert DeMarco (Linda) and Jerry DeMarco (Anne Bell).Over the years Mary loved both hosting and attending the numerous family gatherings. As the grandchildren multiplied, so did the family visits. Many of her grandchildren's fondest memories are of painting with their Nana on the "back porch" at Oakleigh.

Her parents both emigrated from what is now Ukraine. She was predeceased last year by her sister Frances and earlier by her sisters Leona Lukaniuk, Lillian, Mary Bailey, Margaret Roache and Pat Pracey.She is survived by two sons, Ian (Sally Coutts) of Ottawa and Brian (Denise), as well as five grandchildren: Cara Austen, Adam Austen, Timothy Austen, Danielle Feltham and Miranda Van Velzen. She also had five great-grandchildren.When she was a young teenager in 1941, Helen boarded a train in Dauphin with her mother, her sister Fran and a sack of sandwiches to join some of the other sisters who had found work in Windsor. After the Second World War, her first job was at the International Playing Card company, a position that mixed work with her lifelong passion for card games, ideally ones involving petty gambling.Not long after the war ended, she met and married Ronald B. Austen Jr., a Royal Canadian Air Force veteran who became a chartered accountant. In the early 1950s they moved to the South Windsor home where Helen lived until her death.While Ron and Helen separated in 1968 and later divorced, they remained friends.She joined the staff at St. Leonard's House in the early '70s and remained there until retirement in 1992. Her duties included doing regular tours of Ontario's penitentiaries to interview potential residents.Helen was always curious about the world and new ideas. When she was well into middle age, she graduated with an arts degree from the University of Windsor. She traveled to the Soviet Union long before anyone foresaw its demise and to China in advance of its recent economic transformation. More recently, despite blindness, she enjoyed books, in audio form. She kept a close watch on current events.Her nieces and nephews, their children and grandchildren were an important part of Helen's life.Cottaging along the Lake Erie shoreline in and around Colchester became something of a family tradition.

As a mother, grandmother, nurse, psychologist and mentor, Lois leaves us a world better for having known her.She was born on October 26, 1939 in Cache Bay, Ontario.  Lois was the second of four girls born to Nellie and "Dobbie" Dobson. She leaves behind her three loving sisters, Gail Timm, Betty Allary and Mary Dobson, who were also lifelong friends. She loved her many nieces and nephews from the summers spent at Clear Lake.Lois' formative years growing up in Northern Ontario forged the grit and determination that was her hallmark. There was no challenge that Lois would not attempt. She played in the "bush" and swam in the frosty waters of Clear Lake.  She attended a one room school house and claimed that she walked to Sturgeon Falls for high school. Lois took the bold step of leaving home to complete Nursing training at Ottawa Civic Hospital. It was there that she made lifelong friends and carved a path for the care and compassion she gave to others. It was in Ottawa that she met our Dad, John McGrory, and gave birth to her boys (Jay and Joel McGrory). Meredith McGrory came along a few years later in Windsor.As a Mom, Lois gave us the unconditional love and support to succeed personally, professionally and, most importantly, with our families. She was always there for us, as she was for others. Our spouses, Janice Renaud (Jay), Kim Smith (Joel) and Darren Mercer (Meredith) will miss her as much as we do. We know she was proud of us all and we are her legacy.No one was a more loving, doting and involved Grandma. Lois adored her grandchildren, "The Girls" as she called Emma, Abigail and Charlotte McGrory and the rare Dobson male, Jake McGrory (who she proudly called "my favourite grandson").  When they were little, Lois never tired of playing "princess" with the girls or building and building some more, with Jake.  Lois loved her cottage at Clear Lake and she was thrilled when we visited her there. She would teach her grandchildren kayaking and take them blueberry picking on the "mountain".Lois started her nursing career in Buffalo and continued in Detroit after our family moved to Windsor in 1969.  Always a believer in gender equality and feminism, she returned to school and completed an M.A. and Ph.D. in Psychology at the University of Windsor, graduating in 1981. Lois began her third career as a psychologist at the Infant and Family Program. As Executive Director she nurtured this grass roots organization to become what it is today, Children First. Lois touched the lives of many families whose young children had special needs.In retirement, when she was not travelling or spending summers at her cottage Lois enjoyed numerous activities. She was an avid birder, enjoyed reading, going to the movies and trips to the Symphony and Opera with friends. Her closest friend, and fourth sister, was Helen Martin. Their friendship began in the 1960's and endured. She will be missed by Helen's children, Tal and Dafna Czudner, who fondly called her Aunt Lois.If desired, donations in Lois' name can be made to one of her favorite charities, Doctors Without BordersWe are grateful for everyone's love and support in the past month. We are also grateful for the guidance from Dr. Roxanna Chow and her caring personal and medical attention.

During his tenure, George chaired nine Senate Committees, established the Organization of Part-Time Students (OPUS), led the drive in the creation of the UW Alumni Sports Hall of Fame and the Alumni Award for Distinguished Contributions to University Teaching. He was the founding president of the Canadian Association of College and University Student Services (CACUSS). He was the recipient of the Gold Medal in History, the Samuel MacLaughlin Fellowship, the Fr. Eugene Carlisle LeBel Award, the Christian Culture Series Gold Medal, and an Honorary Doctorate of Civil Laws Honoris Causa for his great contributions to both Assumption College and the University of Windsor. During his retirement, George authored four books relating to the history of his beloved university.George also devoted his limitless time and energy to the Air Cadet League of Canada. He began his association with the Royal Canadian Air Cadets in 1947 as a cadet with #310 Squadron (RCAC). He served as the squadron's commanding officer obtaining the rank of Squadron Leader. He went on to serve as Regional Director of the Air Cadet League's Ontario Provincial Office, Area Vice Chair (Western Ontario), and as a member of the National Board of Governors. He was a founding member of Wing #412 of the Royal Canadian Air Force Association of Windsor, and was elected to the positions of National Director, National Vice President and President of the RCAFA. In recognition of his outstanding work and devotion to the cadets and the Windsor community, George was awarded the 1967 Centennial Medal, Canada 125 Medal, Queen's Jubilee Medal, Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal, Ontario Award for Volunteerism, and the Distinguished Service Medal Award. In 2002, he was invested into the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (Knights Templar). George was nominated to be a Torchbearer in the Vancouver 2010 Olympics Torch Relay and on December 23, 2009, he proudly carried the torch along Riverside Drive.Accomplishing all of this, and so much more, George still made family a priority in his life. If it was important to you, it was important to him. He had that rare ability to make everyone feel that they were special and were his favourite. George was the center of attention and life of the party at all family gatherings. We will miss his singing, his sense of humour and his indomitable spirit. He was proud, he was loved, he was heaven blessed, and he gave to all of us a gift that we will always cherish, our family. We have no doubt that the words of St. Matthew, "Well done good and faithful servant!" (Matt. 25:23) have welcomed him into his Heavenly home.A memorial Mass and funeral service will be planned at an appropriate time when it is safe for family and friends to gather openly to appropriately celebrate George's remarkable life.

1296	D. Rosemary Cassano	D. Rosemary	Cassano	NULL	NULL	Windsor	Ontario	2020-12-12 00:00:00-05	https://windsorstar.remembering.ca/obituary/d-rosemary-cassano-1081149056	CASSANO, DR. D. RosemaryBA, MSW, PhD, RSWMarch 31, 1942 - December 4, 2020It is with profound sadness that we, Rosemary's family and friends, announce her passing after a long period of hospitalization.  Predeceased by her parents, Elizabeth (Bessie) and Francesco (Cicio), and her brother, Frank.  Survived by her sister-in-law, Marilyn Cassano; nephews, Stephen and David; great-nephews, Patrick and Oliver.  Deeply missed by her lifelong friends from her childhood, Doreen Powell and Elaine Iannuzziello.In her early working years, Rosemary was employed as a social worker both at the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children and Dellcrest Children's Centre, Toronto. In 1979, while pursuing her PhD in Social Work through the University of Toronto, she joined the faculty at the University of Windsor as an Assistant Professor in the School of Social Work.  She completed her PhD in 1985 and in 1989 she was promoted to Associate professor, a position she held until her retirement in 2008.  In 2003, in recognition of her outstanding teaching to the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Rosemary received the 'Teaching Award - University of Windsor' and in 2005, she received a 'University of Windsor Service Award'.  During her tenure at the University, Rosemary also taught graduate doctoral students in the Department of Psychology, authored a number of books and articles related to clinical social work, and served on university committees.  She particularly enjoyed her position as the 'Chair of the Master of Social Work Program' and she was proud to have been the Social Work 'lead', working jointly with Dr. Anne Forrest in Women's Studies to develop a program that combined Social Work and Women's Studies.  Of their collaboration, Dr. Forrest recently wrote, "She was a wonderful colleague and early champion of women's issues at the University. I also had the privilege of working with her to create the Bachelor of Social Work in Social Work and Women's Studies degree program in the early 2000's. Rosemary's knowledge of the social work profession, her belief in the value of feminist knowledge and practice, and her influence in the school of social work were critical to the success of that initiative...the combined program was the first such undergraduate program in Canada and remains so, today, after all of these years."  Along with her academic career, Rosemary maintained a private clinical practice in Windsor.  She served on several Windsor community boards including Hiatus House.  She was a member of Unity Spiritual Center and served as President of the Board for two terms.Small in stature, gregarious and brilliant, Rosemary lived her life to the fullest. Growing up in Toronto, she was very proud of her Italian heritage, cherishing her family and their traditions especially those that brought her many close relatives together for multi-course meals. Her first trip to Europe in 1967 opened her eyes to the joy of travel and subsequently, over the years, she travelled to many places, including Russia, India and China.  Her favorite however, was a trip to Bali with noted author and scholar, Jean Houston.  Rosemary was wise and pragmatic, an approach that she applied to her clinical practice and to friends and family who sought her advice to help guide them through life's challenges. She told stories with a flair, she adored her Siamese kitties, loved art, classical music, the Windsor Symphony Orchestra, theatre and opera. Her home was filled with books and treasures from her many travels and guests always enjoyed the wonderful aromas emanating from her kitchen. She was a deeply spiritual woman who gave generously to many organizations in support of their work with people in need and she faithfully supported organizations in the care of animals.As her family members were at a distance, Rosemary made many close friends in Windsor-Essex who supported her with love and loyalty during her happy, healthy days, and, most recently during her illness.  In speaking of her passing, her close friend and colleague, Dr. Judith Dunlop, shared, "Rosemary's legacy goes on in the hundreds of social workers she has taught and mentored who revere her. Her legacy lives on in the deep and enduring friendships she has created. We have all lost a special woman too soon. The only consolation is that her suffering is over and she is re-united with her beloved parents and brother."Cremation has been completed.  A "Celebration of Life" service will take place at Unity Spiritual Centre in the spring.

She was a truly good person, and is deeply mourned by her family and friends. Suzanne was loved by and was a loving wife to Stuart, and was a devoted mother to her children: Peter and his wife Janet, and her widowed daughter Rosemary. She was a dedicated grandmother to Isaac and Rachel and to Sylvia and Kyle, and they loved her in turn. She loved and was loved by her sister Victoria and her husband Dan, and by her brother Stephen and his wife Sheryl, and her nephews and nieces.Suzanne was born in New York City and grew up on Long Island, and held a BSc and an MA from Columbia University, where she met and married Stuart when they were graduate students at Columbia. She taught Junior High School English in the inner city until she came to Saskatoon with Stuart in 1964. She was an instructor and researcher at the University of Saskatchewan until coming to Windsor in 1970 when Stuart was appointed to the faculty at the University of Windsor. Suzanne took up a social work career, and served at the Children's Aid Society until studying for and receiving a BSW and an MSW from the University of Windsor. She served as a Faculty Field Instructor in the School of Social Work for several years, and then completed the last twenty years of her career as a talented child and family therapist at the Regional Children's Centre at Windsor Western Hospital.Suzanne developed many lasting friendships with the women she worked with and with the women from Windsor Jewish community; she will be much missed by her friends. She enjoyed reading and sharing in book clubs, and she also enjoyed birding at Point Pelee and Ojibway Park. The family did lots of tent camping in their early years, and often visited family in the USA. She liked living in South Windsor and being with her fine neighbors. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, there will be a small private funeral to allow her family and friends to express their love and respect for her and to share their caring with each other.

Also, his Skye in the prairies and his good friend Steven Cameron.Mark and Margo liked watching the telly, were film buffs, golfing partners, traveling companions and avid sports participants and fans (not always the same team). They followed their football teams and March Madness with great enthusiasm. Mark was delighted but humble about his four holes-in-one and greatly enjoyed his golfing, football and movie buddies. He also liked the theatre and had many fun outings with friends and family over the years, including recent trips to Stratford with his darlings, serenading them with songs from the Sound of Music the entire way there.He loved words, crosswords, Boggle and Beowulf. His favourite was Scrabble and his fiercest opponent was his mum. A cottage visit was never complete unless they had a game. The cottage was always a special place filled with fun, food and family. Mark was an important original founding member of the family safety committee. Camping was an adventure and boating even more so.He was an uncle par excellence. The kids meant the world to him. He enjoyed their many different interests, whether it was music, sports, games or books. He could really PLAY. He was so very proud of them. He was also a long-time sponsor of his international kids.His newspaper family was an important part of his life. Past and present they were more than colleagues, they were his friends. Mark started out as a copy boy at the Windsor Star but prior to that he attended Hugh Beaton, Harrow senior public school and Harrow high school. He also attended the University of Windsor and Wilfred Laurier. He received a journalism diploma from St. Clair College and a passion was born.Mark excelled as a journalist whether it was as a reporter, photographer, editor or someone to help hold up the bar at the press club. He won awards and he truly shone as an editor. A close colleague wrote, "I can't imagine someone of his calibre ever gracing the editing rim again at the Windsor Star."After his start at the Windsor Star, he was hired by the Stratford Beacon Herald where he worked as a reporter and made fabulous friendships. He returned to the Windsor Star to work as a reporter/photographer. He was the police/court reporter followed by a lengthy period as the assistant sports editor. In 2014, he became the night news editor. Mark cared very deeply about the newspaper and nothing but his best effort would do. This became increasingly difficult with cutbacks and constantly being short-staffed. He continued to put his heart into it.He will be greatly missed.Mark had become increasingly handy, he built a fabulous deck with his dad and brothers and this fall he re-did the gardens and built new steps with his nephew. He was energetic, smart, engaged, compassionate and caring. In our family he was the King of Maitland. He was an East Beach Blackdog. He was our family photographer and our go-to guy for so many things. We are all devastated by his death.Thank you to everyone for all your kind, heartfelt words and thoughts.

Born November 13, 1936 in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec to Frank and Filomena DeLuca, he is survived by his sister Nora DeLuca and his best friend and cousin Angela Casciato. Predeceased by his close cousin Robert Casciato (Judy). Gabe leaves behind his wife of 49 years, Shirley (nee Brennan), their daughter Danielle Moubarak (Georges) and son Stephen, as well as his grandsons William and Nicholas Moubarak. He was everyone's favourite uncle and was loved dearly by the Brennan and Janisse families. His early years were spent in St. Catharines, where his family moved in 1944. He became a teacher and was head of the English Department at Denis Morris High School before being recruited to the University of Windsor's Student Affairs Department in 1966. After 10 years in education, Gabe felt the call of opportunity to open Windsor's first Tim Horton Donuts franchise in 1976, followed by another location and a few more entrepreneurial ventures over the coming years. In 1985 he found his passion for real estate and continued that profession for the next 28 years. Throughout his life, Gabe's easygoing manner, loyalty, and sense of humour earned him many great friends. In particular, he will be missed by his beloved "Dodo Birds" group from university, who remain close to this day after over 50 years of friendship.

She was fiercely intelligent and her quick wit delighted those around her until her last days. In her twenties she met the love of her life Ernie Spickett and shortly after that, they began their life together. Both Mary Lou and Ernie came from large families and they wanted that for themselves. Together they had 7 children, followed by 10 grandchildren and 15 great- grandchildren. They passed on their strong values of equality and respect for all to their children and grandchildren, along with strong family relationships - leading by example.Mary Lou was the cherished mother of the late Ernest (2014) and wife Cheryl Spickett, Michael and wife Debbie Spickett, Dr. Laura Arbour of Victoria, BC, Lisa and husband David Koscic, Matthew and wife Donna Spickett, Mark Spickett and spouse Gilles Simon of Toronto and Leslie Spickett. She was the loving grandma of Sandy and husband Don Chang, Brandon Spickett and spouse Lori, Shane Spickett, Chad and wife Lynda Spickett, Nicole and husband Kevin Morassut, Eric and wife Randi Spickett, Kelly Spickett and fiancé Mark Riberdy, Rachel and husband Brian Gererd, Matthew Koscic of Toronto and Dr. Sarah Koscic and fiancé Dr. Joshua Gilgan of Toronto. Great-grandma (GG) of Maya, Carter, Violet, Joshua, Alexis, Arya, Morganne, River, Hunter, Heidi, Leyland, Lyla, Calvin, Abigail and Norah. Dear daughter of the late Jack and Alta McCann.

At that time she was working at the University of Windsor Leddy Library and retired in 1995. About then, she got the travel bug taking her to places like Ireland, the east coast of Canada, Alaska, the Hawaiian Islands, the island of Bequia, Isla Mujeres, Mexico, Aruba, Vancouver and Victoria, BC and took several cruises. She had a keen sense of adventure, but also loved being at home in Windsor, especially during the baseball season when she could turn on a Tigers game. Mary Lou loved hosting all of her family for celebrations and visits. There was always the perfect balance of good food and chaos that kept them coming back. Her strong faith guided her through the last difficult months of her life. She will be missed, but importantly her family are grateful for the time they had with her as she provided strength, wise counsel and a lot of fun. Her typical toast at gatherings reminded us "We are all so lucky".We will be forever grateful to our sister Leslie Spickett for the love, support and care she provided to Mary Lou throughout the years especially in this last year of her life when her needs were the greatest.We also appreciate the many angels who provided care, in particular, Michelle from Bayshore who was with Mary Lou for several years.

He was 80 years old.Bill is sadly missed by his wife, Susanne, and children: Katherine (Jeff Clarkson) McVinnie, Tuscaloosa AL; David (Paula Vozza) McVinnie, Windsor ON; and Alison (Kevin Crozier) McVinnie (Fergus, ON); grandchildren: Michael, Lindsay, and Christopher Clarkson; Nora, Matthew and Robert McVinnie; and Ronan and Jack Crozier. Bill is fondly remembered by his sister Mary Ann (James) Shirk, cousins Robert (Laurel) and Richard (Susan) McVinnie, of Rockford, IL, brother-in-law Donald Campbell, HI, as well as many nieces and nephews, extended family members, colleagues, and dear friends.Bill was born in Rockford, IL on September 4, 1939 to Wayne and Margaret (nee' Shipman) McVinnie. Bill's father's brother, Wilson, returned from service in the South Pacific in WWII, to marry Margaret's younger sister, Odetta. His grandmother, Blanche Shipman, was the anchor of the two close families, helping to raise her grandchildren. He graduated from Harlem High School, class of 1957, where he was a proud member of the celebrated football team that won Conference Championships in both 1956 and 1957.At the University of Illinois, Bill met a fellow student, Susanne (Susie) Campbell. They were married September 3, 1961, the year they both graduated from the University of Illinois, a lasting partnership for almost 60 years. Bill graduated with a Bachelorʼs in Civil Engineering and went on to earn his Masterʼs Degree (1963) and Ph.D. (1966). He taught engineering at the University of Windsor, and then the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. In 1972, he took a full-time position at Chrysler Corporation, Detroit, MI, where he worked until his retirement in 2003.Bill was instrumental in bringing a supercomputer to Chrysler, the first Detroit automaker to own one. He and another Chrysler engineer donated their time at night and used the supercomputer to design a boat to represent the United States in the 1987 Americaʼs Cup Race. The computer allowed them to achieve the model that would most efficiently move through water. Bill took the research concepts in structural design that he had established in his Ph.D. to evaluate thousands of design studies, and used the supercomputer to apply them to analyze the strength and integrity of the automotive body structure. This saved building expensive prototype cars and crash-testing them, eventually shortening product development time for a new vehicle from five years down to two. Most importantly, it saved lives: these optimized computer-aided auto designs were better able to safely manage the energy in a crash and protect the occupants from serious injuries.Bill enjoyed sailing, travel, time "Up North", reading, and watching sports. He was blessed to have many years to get acquainted with his grandchildren, spend vacations with them and their parents, and welcome them for holidays at the house in Clarkston.He was predeceased by parents Margaret and Wayne McVinnie; maternal grandmother, Blanche Shipman; and Aunt and Uncle Wilson and Odetta McVinnie, who were especially close.Due to Covid-19 pandemic, a memorial will be held at a later date.In lieu of flowers, contributions are encouraged to ASPCA, Detroit Rescue Mission Ministry, or University of Illinois Civil and Environmental Engineering.For further information, phone Lynch & Sons, Milford at 248-684-6645.

She passed away on 10 April 2020 at the age of 82. Patricia was kind, loving, and well loved. She adored smiling and laughing, and will be remembered most for her indelible humour. She retained a lingering mischievousness throughout her life, and was always ready to have fun, sing, and dance. We all shared in many impromptu dances, and in the occasional game of cribbage or cookie baking extravaganza. Her warm smile was always well matched by gorgeous, well-styled hair. She loved to talk and reminisce. She was proud of having gone back to school later in life, gaining a Certificate in Organizational and Career Development from the University of Windsor in 1983. Always generous with what she had - like sharing her groceries with the homeless and small items at home with her grandchildren - Patricia was big hearted. She was born on 30 August 1937 in Windsor, Ontario to Leo and Gladys Finn (Shaw), the second among four (late) siblings Ronald, Gerald, and William. Patricia is survived by her four children, Donna Payne(Durand) (Alan), Deanna Durand-Peragine (Dominic), Richard Durand, and Daniel Durand, and her grandchildren Shaunda, Crystal, Tawnya, Alexandra, Malynda, Vincent, Haylee, and Shaylyn, and 11 great grandchildren, and three great-great grandchildren.

His brother and sister-in-law Frank and Pat Roberts, brother-in-law Gene Veneri and sister-in-law Marge Victor precede him in death. Anyone else fighting MDS for 7+ years would have given up the fight a long time ago but Larry was not going to be taken down easily. Although exhaustion pursued his last days, he was positive and never complained. He didn't live like he was dying. He died like he was living. His passion for life, his family, golf, music and literature were constants throughout his entire life and continued until the end. Classical and jazz music were really the soundtrack of his life. He spent countless hours in his library with a Vivaldi concerto pumping through his 13 speakers reading A People's History. Everyone knew him on the golf course for his infectious smile and sense of humour. He would throw his arm around your shoulder with a warm "my buddy, my pal, my main man." He was known for his love of the Christmas season, pizza and red wine, potato chips, fishing, his puzzles, sunsets, sunrises on the water, the cottage, having his family around him and his beautiful wife beside him. Larry was born on April 14, 1936 in Windsor, ON to his parents, Frank and Dulcie Roberts. He attended Assumption H.S. from 1950-1954 and then graduated from the University of Windsor with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1959. He later went back to the University to complete his Master's degree in 1971. Larry started his teaching career at Massey SS and finished at WD Lowe 34 years later. He tells the story of meeting Ilene in 1960 and falling head over heels at first sight. How he could not wait until the second date to see her again and that, he knew she was the 'one'. He married his love in June of 1962 and started their family shortly after. He retired in 1993 and continued his passion of reading and writing. A special acknowledgement goes out to the Princess Roberts, the East Beach posse, the Destin crew and the Erie Shores gang for all the love, laughs and support over the years. A heartfelt thank you goes out to the staff at the Erie Shores HealthCare Center, particularly in Ambulatory Care (Laura, Lynn, Mandy and Tracy) for their kindness, gentleness and compassion through his many transfusions and visits.

She passed away at Erie Shores Hospice on Wednesday, October 30, 2019 with her family by her side after a quick but courageous battle with cancer. Liz was a well-respected and much-loved member of this community, and a devoted wife, mother and Nana at home. Born and raised in Essex County, Liz trained at The Metropolitan School of Nursing in Windsor before beginning her career at Victoria Hospital in London, Ontario and Leamington District Memorial Hospital. Leaving shift work behind to raise her two daughters, Liz moved on to office administration roles at two local dental offices and an insurance broker where she earned a reputation for providing exceptional customer service, being an invaluable team player, and always having a ready smile. At the age of 49, Liz 'retired' from her office administration role to return to school. Without an undergraduate degree, she was accepted on the basis of her life experience into Assumption University at the University of Windsor to pursue a Degree in Theology. Once completed, she went on to receive her Master's Degree in Pastoral Ministry. In 2002, she was ordained as a deacon in the Anglican Church of Canada and became The Reverend Deacon Liz Chaplin. In subsequent years, Liz would serve as the Chaplain for the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 84 Leamington, The Sun Parlor Home for Senior Citizens and Leamington District Memorial Hospital. During her time at LDMH, Liz was influential in creating a Butterfly Garden for the Perinatal Bereavement Program, orchestrated a Prayer Room inside the hospital, and began a Christmas "Tree of Hope" campaign to provide assistance to local families. Upon her 'retirement' from Leamington Hospital, Liz then became the Chaplain on staff at the Erie Shores Campus of The Hospice of Windsor and Essex County where she devotedly served the patients and their families. Liz spent her career emphasizing that each person was more than just a customer, each patient more than just a diagnosis. She believed that using a person's name was important; that respect and dignity was everyone's right; that the end of life was not the end of the journey. Liz Chaplin has touched the lives of many, shared in their stories, and was humbly honoured to do so. Liz is greatly missed by her loving husband, Bill Chaplin of Leamington; by her beloved daughters, Darlene Pursel and husband Ian Tate, and Heather Latam and husband Justin; by her cherished grandchildren, Duncan, Harley, Jordan, Jamie, Joelly, Joon, and Heath; and by her siblings, Richard Manningham and wife Maureen, Margaret Robinson, David Manningham and partner Wendy Hicks.

Beloved husband to Ferdinanda Van Gennip, with whom he celebrated 24 years of marriage. Loving father of Peter (Deanna Radford) of Montreal, QC and Elizabeth of Montreal, QC. Predeceased by his first wife, Anne Elizabeth Wyatt, his parents, Mary White and William Burton and his sister-in-law, Waltera Van Gennip. He is survived by his cousins in Ireland, Jim Kiely (Be), Bill White (Josie) and Mary French (Bill) and his brother-in-law in England, John Wyatt (Yvonne), as well as his sisters-in-law Mary Ann McKenzie (Charlie) of Stouffville, ON and Lamberta Baker (Larry) of Barrie, ON. Bruce wishes to thank the Crowell, Briggs and Nelson families, all of whom were especially important in welcoming Bruce and Anne and their children to Windsor upon their arrival in 1966. These ties remained over the years, and Bruce felt immense gratitude for their warm friendship and hospitality.  Bruce was born in the district of World's End, Chelsea, London in 1933. He grew up in the Kew area of London until age six, when he was evacuated to Berwick-Upon-Tweed to live with his Aunt Ada and Uncle Bob as World War II began. After the war, Bruce was educated mainly by the Salesian Fathers at boarding schools at Chertsey and Battersea. At the age of 17 he went up to Oxford University, where he read History, graduating in 1954. While there, he was very active in the Oxford Union. A talented debater, he and fellow student Jonathan Boswell travelled to India to represent the Union, spending four months debating at various universities. He also spent a summer as a reporter with the Huddersfield Daily Examiner.  In 1957 Bruce obtained an MA in Social Science from the Institute of Social Science (ISS) in The Hague, followed by a teaching stint for the American University of Maryland at the U.S. Embassy in London. From 1961 to 1964, Bruce helped establish the International Relations Program at ISS and taught there from 1964 to 1966. These five years were foundational for Bruce's career as a political scientist.  On one of his visits back to London, Bruce met Anne Wyatt, who was working as an assistant to a BBC producer. He returned often to visit her and she came often to The Hague to visit him. They married in 1964, settling in The Hague. In 1966, Bruce, with Anne and one-year old Peter, migrated to Windsor, Ontario, where he took a position as a professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Windsor. Once again, he was charged with establishing an International Relations program. During his tenure at the University, his work took him on research trips to China, Vietnam and Burma. Bruce retired from the University of Windsor in 1998 but continued to be an active member of the university community, serving as thesis advisor to graduate students. Throughout his career and in retirement, Bruce also served as consultant on Asian politics to provincial and federal leaders.  In 1993, he met Ferdinanda at Holy Cross Centre for Ecology and Spirituality. They married in 1995. Bruce and Ferdinanda were both passionate about environmental and social justice issues and facilitated workshops on these topics. Spending time on the Ganatcho Trail, at the Ojibway Nature Centre or in Point Pelee National Park was one of their favourite activities, especially as Bruce had been an avid birder since childhood. As well, they shared a love of Europe, where they enjoyed visiting each other's relatives and friends, in Ireland, Scotland, England, France and the Netherlands.  Bruce was a devout Roman Catholic throughout his life and believed strongly in the importance of ecumenism, interfaith dialogue and ecological engagement. A kind and gentle man, Bruce was a wonderful son, husband, father, friend and colleague. His life was a blessing and he will be greatly missed.

No doubt there will be some ethereal design changes to follow. Jerry was co-founder and senior architect of Glos Associates Inc. Jerry earned his Bachelor of Architecture degree from McGill University. He amassed over 50 years of architectural design experience continuing to work right to the end. He epitomized the adage, "You have to love what you do" and he surely did so, with a passion. A licenced architect, Jerry was a member of the Ontario Association of Architects and the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. A few of his many local projects include the GM Trim Plant, The Adie Knox Herman Memorial Recreation Complex, The Windsor Star printing facility and the Windsor Transit Terminal. He was the recipient of multiple civic design awards for design excellence, including the Premier's Award for Accessibility for the All Saints Church renovation in 1985 and two Windsor Construction Association awards of Merit including the 2011 award for Hospitality Institutions. Jerry was honoured as a "Fellow" at the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada Convocation in Calgary in June 2014. His unwavering commitment to his community also led him to win the Charles Clark Award in recognition of his countless volunteer contributions to the University of Windsor. His other passion was his family. Jerry took his children and grandchildren on many travel adventures, most recently over New Years on a Caribbean Cruise. He is survived by his loving wife of 62 years, Geraldine, leaving her with many beautiful memories and a closet full of snazzy men's clothes. Jerry provided his most fortunate children Martha (John) Burrows and Tim (Krista) Glos with a life that most could only dream of. He was a role model, a cheerleader, a man of deep Christian faith and an inspiration to his most cherished grandchildren McKenzie and Addie Burrows, Julia (fiancé Michael Knight), Amanda, Isaac and Eric Glos. As a member of many Boards and Committees during his lifetime, the one closest to his heart was CEO, CFO and driver of the Boys Club, which was simply him and his three grandsons. Many serious decisions were made at meetings usually held at Timmys where the CFO was responsible for the refreshments. Jerry has joined his brothers Carl, Martin, David and John on the new job site and is survived by one sister Mary (late Ed) Rishaw and many nieces and nephews.

When reminiscing about that period of his life, Bob characterized himself a beatnik,  and published poetry. He earned an MA and a PhD.In 1963, Bob joined the University of Windsor Philosophy Department  until 1999 when he retired Emeritus. He was an "Informal Logician" who focused on Argumentation Theory.He is fondly remembered for his commitment to students, theatrical flair and humour. One student wrote, "While I can barely remember some of my graduate school teachers, I remember Pinto like it was yesterday...because he is a flesh and blood character, and not, as Kierkegaard would say, a 'broomstick'...He could get you laughing regardless of how down in the dumps you might be feeling."The last year of Bob's life shed light on the immense problems with long-term care (LTC) resulting from profits over people. At the same time that the Bob's LTC took in $1.1 billion in revenue, paid its CEO $3.9 million, and issued $47 million in shareholder dividends, they were cited for non-compliance by for short-staffing, failing to protect residents from assault, and a host of other violations. Tireless advocacy failed to stop abuse and neglect.In the spirit of Bob's commitment to fighting injustice and his recent experience, the family asks that in lieu of flowers that you contact the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and your MPP to demand reform to the system in his name, and consider sending an acerbic letter to the CEO of any for-profit corporation providing long-term care. If these suggestions are (in Bob's words) "not your style," then take some time to enjoy Bob's written work (#TheRealPinto) and take up his lifelong "invitation to inference" by engaging in meaningful argumentation with a friend, loved one, or colleague.Bob is survived by wife Brone and daughter Laura (Adam), and predeceased by his son, Rob and his sisters Carol and Andrea.A celebration of Bob's life will take place at a later date.		t	NULL	NULL	42.3	-83.03

Her sister Bernice (Morris) and many close cousins brought her endless joy and comfort.Wilma was a gifted educator specializing in reading readiness and literacy skills. Her talents quickly led her to a position as primary school coordinator for the Sandwich West School Board. She loved teaching and was well-loved by her students. Early married life found Wilma thriving in Leamington, Ontario in another role, that of motherhood.In 1977 she obtained a BA from the University of Windsor and graduated the same day as her oldest daughter. She continued to teach both for the Windsor Hebrew Day School and the Windsor Board of Education.She appreciated the interaction between learning and play and always encouraged her children to explore and embrace different cultures. Extended camping trips remain a source of family lore. While her artistic inclinations were many, she shone the brightest with her beautiful home and garden. She called her grandchildren "the flowers of our garden."Wilma embraced sports both as a participant and as a spectator. Her allegiance to the Detroit Tigers started as a young girl and continued with spring training trips to Florida. She not only supported the Tigers as a spectator but cheered loudly for her kids and grandkids at countless sporting events.Wilma and Jim travelled to many beautiful countries but their rustic Lake Superior cottage was her special place; a devoted dog always at her side. Here, at day's end, the Algoma sunsets gave her much pleasure and contentment. She lived a long life of tenderness, kindness and compassion.The family wishes to thank Wilma's personal care givers: Linda, Jane, Stacey, Kelsey and Lisa for their compassion and care over these many months.

She grew up in Toronto, graduated from Harbord Collegiate and began her studies at the University of Toronto. Helen's plans changed when she married Sydney Sharpe, and as a 20-year-old bride, moved to Windsor.Her boys were born and raised in Windsor. Helen devoted herself to her family, to her volunteer work and her fight to free Soviet Jews. When, in the mid-1970's, Helen was obliged to find a job, her friend Harvey Strosberg offered her one as a secretary in his law firm. In no time, Helen realized two things: she had none of the skills necessary to be a secretary, and second, she wanted to be a lawyer. With Harvey's encouragement, she applied to, attended and graduated from the University of Windsor Law School, and, at age 50, was called to the Bar.She practised law in Windsor for a number of years before moving to Toronto to be closer to family. Helen immersed herself in her family and continued to practise law. She also took up the sport of dragon boat paddling, the eldest breast cancer survivor by decades of all her teammates. As well, Helen undertook several tours of duty as a Sar-El volunteer, serving on IDF bases across Israel. She greased tank parts, packed medics' kits and painted and refilled jerry cans.At age 70, Helen decided to fulfill her lifelong dream to make aliyah and move to Israel. By herself, with no family and few friends, she moved to Jerusalem and set about making a brand-new life for herself. By force of her personality and her character, she was able to quickly develop a number of deep friendships. She was welcomed into their families, and in turn, those families became a cherished part of her own family. Despite a number of health challenges over the last 17 years, Helen loved her life in Jerusalem and would not have traded it for anything. The quality of her life in Israel was due in no small part to the love, devotion and commitment of her friends. That devotion was incredible and it was mutual.Sister, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, lawyer, 45-year breast cancer survivor, dragon boat paddler, Sar-El veteran, dear friend.Helen was a force to be reckoned with. May her memory be for a blessing.Burial took place at Eretz Hachaim cemetery in Israel, and shiva began there.

Devoted and beloved husband of Magdalena (nee Csoregi) for 61 adventurous years. Much loved and admired father of Judith Szecsei-Beale, Darlene Szecsei-Albano and husband Joe, and predeceased by his dear daughter Maggie Szecsei-Toth (2002). Cherished "Papa" of Lauren, Hillary, Maxwell, Winston, Karmen (Laura) and Andrea. Dearest brother of Elizabeth (the late Laszlo Kovacs Jr., survived by Erika and their son Gabor-in Hungary), and predeceased by his brother Pal (the late Magdolna), sister Maria (the late Janos), the late Ferike. Forever remembered "Dedi" by Eve Rioux and husband Richard and their children Christopher (Joseph's godson, Christopher's wife Alexandra and daughter Teya), Eve's children Andrew (Brent), Erika (Randall and their children Noa and Nash). Dear brother-in-law of the late Clara (2015), survived by god-children Alex (Robin), Clara (Paul and their children Cassondra and Cameron). Joseph immigrated to Canada in 1952, as a tool maker looking for a place to continue his life long passion. In 1956, Joseph founded Titan Tool and Die Ltd. and Futura Tool Inc.

In his spare time, and after being charged by three elephants in Africa, he invented and patented two double barrel bolt action repeaters. He was past president of Mindszenty Hall, where he continued to support his roots through this cultural center. Joseph was extremely compassionate and understanding, for he shared his wisdom and craft with many over the years. All who knew him left with a humorous twist to the experience. Joseph's biggest challenge was being diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease over 20 years ago, where his biggest strength became living his dream through those he loved. Special thanks to "the dream team" of nurses, Shelby, Felicia, Claudia, Zoya, Sarah and Ashley for their love and compassionate care. Although Joseph was passionate about many things, his greatest passion was the love he shared for his dear family.

True friend to Paul, Carl, Dennis and Marvin. Caregiver to rescued Pookie, Melrose, and Luigi. Everyone who knew David knows about his love for planes, trains, and automobiles. David was a Second class stationary engineer at General Chemical, Hiram Walker, and the University of Windsor. Owning several motorcycles, fast cars, power and sailboats, building three telescopes, and obtaining his pilot’s licence in aviation, David was a going concern. David also loved scuba diving, astronomy, and photography, outfitting his own darkroom, and showing his photos at Gibson Gallery. A meticulous self-taught woodworker, he spent hours in the "shop" in the garage, able to fix anything that needed fixing, which led granddaughter, Kat, to proclaim, "Give it to Grampa. Grampa can fix anything!" He taught himself calculus, loved ZZ Top and Fat Boys, Harley Davidson motorcycles, and model trains. David crewed on the Schooner Nathanial Bowditch and painstakingly built dozens of model boats from scratch. A lifelong learner and volunteer, David loved helping people and meant so much to so many. He was an instructor for the Canadian Power and Sail Squadron (CPS) which led to self-taught (N) Navigation. David captured 1st place in the 1987 WSSC solo. David captained Juergen Hendel’s beloved Rakaia and placed 1st, winning the 1994 Grampa PHRF Regatta. David received a Steering Testimonial as a competent wheelsman in 1999. He was a devoted volunteer for Canadian Power and Sail Squadrons (CPS), Marsh Collection Society, Canadian Historical Aircraft Association (CH2A), Elder College, and a member of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC). He was a regular contributor to the Marsh Collection’s ’Reflections’ and edited dozens of volumes of ’Echo Soundings’ (marine news excerpts from the Amherstburg Echo). During the time David spent with CH2A, he had the distinct privilege of building the navigator’s desk for Windsor’s Lancaster bomber, salvaging as much from the original desk as possible; David dedicated this desk to his cousin, William Hamilton, who flew a Lancaster over Germany during World War II. William did not make it home. Most of all, David loved his family, spending hours on the road to Batchawana Bay where he first learned his love for sailing; a freezing trip to Winnipeg tor observe a total solar eclipse; travelling to Arizona to see the Grand Canyon, visiting Mount Rushmore and Devil’s Tower, riding the Silver Streak to Colorado, sailing to Cedar Point for a terrifying ride on the Demon Drop, the infamous elk story in Algonquin, saving the family from certain death while backing the ’gut-less Cutlass’ down Blue Mountain, beer tasting at Walkerville Brewery Tours and G.L. Heritage Brewery. He enjoyed playing chess and games, especially playing the dreaded +4 UNO card when he shouldn’t, LAN parties, Dungeons & Dragons, watching old B-rated science fiction films, camping and collecting pond samples at Holiday Beach, walking the Boardwalk at Point Pelee and the trails at Ojibway. He loved us and we loved him. He was truly one-of-a-kind and we are blessed to have had him in our lives. Cremation has taken place.

Elizabeth went on to CBE Radio to run her own radio program and became a successful broadcaster in both radio and television. She was a guest on Front Page Challenge multiple times and hosted a twice weekly interview program on local cable. Family remember stories of her peering through the Gates of Buckingham Palace as a young girl hoping to catch a glimpse of the Royals. Having met and hosted dignitaries from all walks of life, one of her fondest memories was overseeing a visit from the Queen in 1984.

The family is so thankful she was alive to see this tribute and thanks them for honouring her in such a thoughtful, enduring way. Elizabeth spent a quiet retirement away from the public eye enjoying walks along the Ganatchio Trail, lunching and shopping on Erie Street, spending time at the Riverside Branch of the Windsor Public Library and enjoying her home of 46 years at Solidarity Tower with friends and neighbours.

1452	Patricia Noonan	Patricia	Noonan	November 3, 1930	August 11, 2018	Windsor	Ontario	2018-08-15 00:00:00-04	https://windsorstar.remembering.ca/obituary/patricia-noonan-1067498316	NOONAN, Patricia Anne87 years. Passed away on August 11, 2018. Pat Noonan left her mark in ways almost impossible to recount. Born November 3, 1930, Pat Noonan lived a full life. She loved to have fun, with a wit and a smile that could light up a room. Pat is renowned as an ardent advocate for social justice. Pat began her commitment to making our world a better place as a young nun. She was a member of the Ursulines of the Chatham Union, having entered the order in 1948, immediately following high school. She worked with the Young Christian Students, a movement which empowers high school students to take faith-based action on social inequalities in the community. She took the name of Mother Raphael and remained a member of the order until 1971. While a nun, she obtained her undergraduate degree at Western University and took many graduate courses in sociology at Notre Dame. Thousands of students were influenced and inspired by Pat, who taught in Mount Carmel, Parkhill, Chatham, and Calgary, Alberta. After leaving the convent, Pat taught high school in Windsor and at St. Clair College, taking early retirement so that she could dedicate her time and energy to issues she was passionate about. A pioneer in Windsor for women’s rights. Pat was co-founder of Women’s Liberation in Windsor and a driving force behind the Women’s Place, a drop-in centre set up in the 1970s with programs for women. The Women’s Place is no longer, but it was the starting place for many of the programs and services now available to women. Pat’s advocacy for women has included involvement in Hiatus House, House of Sophrosyne, the Well-Come Centre, and Women for Sobriety. Pat started Windsor Feminist Theatre, using the power of the arts to raise awareness about women’s issues. John McDonald, her husband and partner at the time, worked alongside Pat on many plays and performances. Pat loved the stage; one of her favorite roles was Pope Joan in Top Girls. An educator at heart, Pat arranged for training for local amateurs from professional directors, writers, and stage managers. Pat’s leadership was sought out and she was a founding member of several groups and organizations focused on equity, rights, and justice. The Lieutenant Governor in Council appointed Pat to the Board of Governors of the University of Windsor, where she served from 1991-1997. Pat was equally comfortable as a member of the Board of Governors as she was participating on a team to build schools in Nicaragua. She was an original Board member of the Windsor Occupational Health Information Service (WOHIS). Long before the MeToo Movement, Pat was a passionate member of the Lori Dupont Inquest Action Group, which successfully  advocated for the inclusion of sexual harassment as a workplace safety issue in Ontario Labour law. An advocate for the environment, Pat was a founding member of Windsor on Watch (WOW). Their work included support for residents in southwest Detroit and the Aamjiwnaang community near Sarnia to address environmental problems affecting the health of people in both communities. Until very recently, Pat was actively involved in Gaia Women of the Great Lakes Basin. a group of women from Canada and United States who share a commitment to Gaia, the planet earth, and sing a message of hope and healing for the planet with proceeds from sales of CD recordings used to support local environmental projects. Pat was also a founding member of Women in Black, a group advocating for non-violent solutions to global issues. Pat’s impact has been publicly recognized, including being named the first recipient of the Windsor Woman of the Year Award in 1983. In 2015, the Council of Canadians bestowed upon Pat Noonan the honour of Activist of the Year. Pat’s story and her impact on so many people and so many causes is documented in the video, “This is what a Feminist Sounds Like,” which premiered at the Windsor International Film Festival in 2013 to a sold out audience. Her life was not all meetings and issues. Pat loved golf and tennis and spent many hours on the course and on the court. Pat recently moved to Royal Marquis Retirement Home and quickly made another circle of friends with staff and residents alike. When her health declined a few days before her death, Pat was moved to Hospice. Thanks to all the staff at Royal Marquis, the LHIN/CCAC, and the staff and volunteers at Hospice for the loving care given to Pat. Pat was predeceased by her three brothers Martin (Marty), John (Jack), and Jerome. She has adult nieces and nephews living in Michigan and Illinois. Energetic, smart, bold, and cheeky, Pat Noonan brought out the best in people. She empowered people and was a true friend. It is difficult for her many, many friends to imagine a world without the driving force that was Pat Noonan. Cremation has taken place.

Beloved husband of Marjorie Morgan for 65 years. Cherished father of Pam and Nancy, his pride and joy. Wonderful father-in-law to Bill Mackay. Very proud grandfather of Meredith, Madeline, Alexander and Zachary. Predeceased by his much- loved family; his parents, Charles and Pearl Morgan and his siblings Fred, Jean, George and Dorothy. Bill graduated from Queen's University in civil engineering later obtaining his MBA from the University of Windsor. In 1948, he accepted a position as City Inspector for the City of Windsor. He held this position until 1957 when he joined the staff at the University of Windsor as Resident Engineer. In 1963, he became Director of Engineering Services, then he climbed to Director of Physical Plant, then he was promoted to Assistant of the Vice President, and finally Vice President of Finances and Services until his retirement in 1989. As a Life member of the Lion's club, he devoted endless hours to Lion's Club causes including Lion's Manor, Leader Dogs for the Blind, and the Lanspeary Lions Rink. He was a devout Anglican and a beloved member of St. James Church. He never complained despite the multiple challenges he endured in the last 12 years of his life. He was a man of few words, unless asked to speak at a significant event where one of his speeches was clocked at greater than 90 minutes. He was fiercely loyal to both Queen's University and the University of Windsor and did not care for any discussion about the University of Western Ontario, especially when it came to football.

Before the Second World War, Diana enjoyed a life filled with Pekingese dogs, horses, art and singing. Diana survived the air raids on London in the Blitz. She suffered a traumatic brain injury that left her temporarily blind and mute. This was the first challenge that an ordinary person would not have overcome. She persevered to recover her vision and lived all her life with a severe speech impediment. At 16, Diana immigrated to Canada with her parents, leaving behind her beloved art school, dogs and horses. They travelled on the Aquitania and entered Canada through the historic Pier 21 in Halifax. They travelled across Canada by train to Vancouver. Diana always said it was a trip every Canadian should make at least once in their life time. They settled in Windsor where at 21 she met her husband Patrick. While it wasn't love at first sight for her, Patrick always said that when he saw her flashing green eyes and red hair he knew that he was going to marry her. The newlyweds' happily-ever-after was interrupted when Diana returned to England with her mother, to whom she was devoted, and nursed her mother until her death from cancer. Always the adventurer, Diana moved with Patrick to Elliot Lake and lived in a tiny trailer at a mine. They became champion archers then returned to Windsor to prepare for the arrival of their first child, Siobhan. Shortly after Siobhan was born, while roofing a house, Patrick fell and broke his back. Diana's father went to finish the job, also fell from the roof and broke his back. The resourceful Diana, put the baby and the invalids into the same room to efficiently care for all three. Her family eventually grew to include Maeve and Fiona. Diana raised her family in Riverside, in a home that was filled with culture, love, laughter and the smell of baked bread. She was a member of the Catholic Women's League and a parishioner of St. Rose of Lima. She also cared for her father at her home until his death in 1976. Diana attended the University of Windsor part time to pursue her studies in Fine Arts. At the very young age of 50, Diana suddenly became widowed. Her unwavering strength and determination allowed her to raise her young daughters and maintain an unbreakable family bond. Diana was infinitely proud to see her daughters through university and loved her sons-in-law Peppino, Peter and Sean whom she loved as her own children. Diana lived her later years until her death with Siobhan and Peppino and was ever grateful to them. She delighted in the growth of her little family to include her grandchildren Julie and her fiancé Claude, Patrick, Conor and his wife Chantel, Catriona and her fiancé Mike, Quinn, Devin, the late Lennan and Fallon; great-grandchildren Dusten, Liam and the late Damien, Lily Rose, Graydon and Benjamin. Diana loved her niece Jennifer and her family who held a special place in her heart. Diana's constant companion in her last years was her beloved Yorkie, Lupo. Diana's strength saw her through many health challenges and she constantly surprised and delighted her family by rallying time after time. Even in this final challenge, she gave Death a run for his money and went on her own terms. Diana was an extraordinary woman who inspired three generations. The inspiration that she was has left a legacy that will continue to live on through her family. A special thank you to Diana's devoted PSWs Maggie and Crystal, Dr. Yap and the 8th floor west staff at Windsor Regional Hospital-Ouellette Campus especially Emily and both Shannons.

Born on August 15, 1915 in Windsor. Beloved husband of Helen Lois (Greenhow) for 75 years. Cherished by his children, Sheila, John (Kathleen) and Peter (Gail); and treasured by his grandchildren Cassie McFarlane (Patrick Kirstein), Paul McFarlane, Joel McFarlane (Jen Scholefield), David, Fraser (Kristen Chamberlain), Kimberly Kelton, Brian (Michael Bernardo), Stephen (Katie), Chrissy Kelton; and his great-grandchildren Stanley Kirstein, Marin, Lane, Natalie Kelton, Wren Kelton. John was predeceased by his parents Matthew and Catherine (McKenzie), sisters Adeline, Anna, Gladys, Mary and brother Matthew. John was a proud employee of the Ford Motor Company of Canada from 1933 until his retirement. He began at Ford as a tool and die worker, while working nights to earn an Engineering degree. John rose at Ford to retire as Manager of Mechanical and Plant Engineering in 1980. His years of hard work were balanced by his devotion to his family, and in turn to their growing families. John also loved sports especially golf, sailing, canoeing, and bicycling. John committed himself to a life of integrity, humbleness, and honour, which reflected his devout Christian beliefs. He was a lifelong and active member of Grace and Truth Chapel of Windsor, where he taught Sunday School for many years. His natural inquisitiveness (plus tuition was free) meant that upon retirement he promptly enrolled in the University of Windsor to learn more about the world, studying subjects ranging from meteorology to biology to macroeconomics. John's shy, but quietly gentle kindness and his ability to listen to and appreciate all with whom he came into contact, lead him to be greatly appreciated by many. John's family extends much gratitude to the staff of Chartwell Royal Oak in Kingsville, Ontario for their loving care during his residence there. Thanks also to Amy's Helping Hands and a special thanks to Samuel Martin for many years of kindness and care. Visitation will take place on Thursday, January 25 from 7 to 8:30 p.m., and Friday from 10 to 11 a.m. at the Walter D. Kelly Life Celebration Centre located at 1969 Wyandotte St. East, Windsor, ON N8Y 1E5. The funeral will take place on Friday, January 26 at 11:00 a.m. at the Walter D Kelly Life Celebration Centre.

Gerry was born in Windsor on November 15, 1940, the youngest child and only son of Gerald and Matilda (Mattie) Dimmick. He was predeceased by his beloved sister Marilyn Menard (2006). Gerry is survived by his wife Joan, his children Margo (Mark), Gerald, Meghan (Lewis) and Jake (Jen), and grandchildren Hamish, Clementine, Matilda and Susannah MacLeod and Mersea Dimmick.Gerry was a history teacher for many years. Teaching was his passion and he gave everything he could to his students. He began his career at Central Collegiate in Sarnia in 1964, before moving back to Windsor and teaching at Walkerville and then Centennial where he became the youngest department head in the city. He worked as a vice-principal at Lowe and Shawnee before becoming principal at Massey. He was a committed coach and mentor who volunteered with many varsity teams, clubs and student councils. He created and taught special classes tailor-made to students who needed extra care and guidance, even while he was working as a principal full-time. Gerry was a champion for the underdog. Giving more of himself was never a problem; it was his instinctive response to all obstacles. He regarded being told that something was impossible as only a suggestion, and he accomplished great things because he was always willing to do more and work harder.He took on a key leadership role with the Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation and was part of a strike that resulted in a landmark collective agreement that helped teachers gain control of their own pensions and made Essex County teachers the highest paid in Canada. In part because of his involvement with the teachers' strike, he decided to study law. While continuing to teach full-time, he completed his law degree at the University of Windsor in 1976.Despite all his professional success, Gerry's greatest accomplishment was being a generous, kind, and warm-hearted person. He was a devoted son, brother, husband, father, grandfather, uncle and friend. He had a magnetic personality with an infectious laugh and a mischievous sense of humour. He loved deeply and unconditionally and the joy of being with his family and friends was unmistakable, genuine and boundless. He believed real wealth was not measured in dollars but in love. By this standard, he was an incredibly wealthy man and he enriched the lives of everyone around him. He will be sorely missed.The family would like to thank the staff of 1 West at Sun Parlor Home for their years of compassionate care for Gerry and for his family. In his memory, donations can be made to the Alzheimer Society or Right to Play. At Gerry's request, cremation has taken place. A gathering for friends and family will be held at a later date.

She obtained her Bachelor of Education from the University of Toronto in 1976. She taught English, Special Education and Guidance for over 30 years. Melissa will be remembered for her outgoing, adventurous and spontaneous spirit. She was the family travel agent, always planning the next trip to ensure that family and friends would be together soon.

She had a gift for friendship, building lifelong relationships wherever she went or lived including Windsor, Brampton, London, Lahr, Germany and Ankara, Turkey (where she and Jim spent 5 wonderful years). Her leisure time was spent in front of the family fireplace, glass of white wine in hand, and only watching shows and movies that would end on a happy note. The family thanks all of the supportive, tireless and compassionate care providers of St. Joseph's Hospice, the London Regional Cancer Program and the University Health Network – Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) in Toronto. Together, with her family, she fought a valiant fight. Melissa was a "tough cookie" and her feistiness saw her through three Clinical Trials and gave us all extended hope.

Beloved mother to Steven (Sarah Curtis) of Mackenzie B.C., Cydney Mckenzie Curtis and guardian parent to Hara Hordofa of Toronto. She was predeceased by her loving mother Veronica Sookram (2016) and by her brother Kerwin Sookram (2003). Kaysandra is survived by her father Jonny Sookram as well as her sisters Sabrina Malaney, Karmille Sookram, Koscina Sookram-Quintal and her brothers Kwencyd Sookram and Kadel Sookram.Kay, the oldest child, was born at home in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago (T and T) on August 16, 1957. Early on she excelled as both a student and an athlete competing with the T and T National field hockey team. Immigrating to Canada in 1977, Kay brought with her many of the values she inherited from the island community, especially that family extended beyond bloodlines. Kay began her career as a nanny. She attended night classes at Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario where she earned a Registered Nurse Diploma. A Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree from the University of Windsor came later. For many years, she worked the intensive care and critical care units at St. Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton and Hotel Dieu Hospital in Windsor. During her marriage she spent many years as the only income earner, providing for her husband and two children. She encouraged her spouse to become an author and later managed him towards a successful career. Kay had an amazing ability to take people under her wing and guide them to achieve far more than they originally believed they could. Her talents expanded into raising funds to create a children's learning center at the Windsor Public Library. She also created the Pediatric R.E.A.D program which delivered books to new mothers to help them understand the importance of reading to children at an early age. She transitioned into a career relating to literacy, creating the business Nothing But Curtis LTD., managing authors, negotiating book deals and organizing events for authors. Her energy and community involvement seemed endless. She was a member of the St. Clair College Board of Governors, President of the Multicultural Council of Windsor and Essex County, Chair of the Carousel of Nations, President of the Rotary Club of Windsor (1918), creator & host of the Cogeco television show Mentors Matter, founder of Divorced D.I.V.A.S and Do Good D.I.V.A.S. Kay was involved in international work, participating in a National Immunization Day in India. She created the Kenyan Tea Party fundraiser to build water towers and school kitchens in Kenya. Her efforts earned her awards and recognition. Lessons she learned in life allowed her to assist many youths and adults, particularly women, overcome obstacles in their lives. Kay became certified in coaching, family mediation and leadership and then created Curtis Coaching Mediation LTD. She was a wonderful example to many women of how to achieve and display power, strength, loyalty and devotion all while being a classy lady. Armed with an appreciation for hard work and education, she led a life that followed an upward trajectory of accomplishments. Her legacy will remain far past the time that we were blessed with her presence. Her inclusivity, kindness, joy for life and sense of style, that was the epitome of elegance, fostered a family of friends in Windsor that shone its light in her greatest time of need.

After we had grown up, mom earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Windsor. She worked as a dietician until she was needed at home, first to care for her mother and then later, our dad who died in 1985. For amusement she enjoyed water-skiing, traveling, and dancing but her main goal was to get each of us four kids off to a good start in life.At the Richmond Terrace Nursing Home, mom would break into dance moves, waving her hands and shimmying her hips, often smiling and winking, with or without music, to the delight of the other residents. As mom's condition deteriorated and the end approached, the staff at Richmond Terrace spared no effort to keep her comfortable and ease the pain of our family.Sadly, most of mom's friends have already passed away. Caloe Ung, mom's private caregiver, gently looked after our mother during the last four years of her life. Jean Echlin provided invaluable counsel at the most difficult moments. Mom had a special place in her heart for Father Eugene Halitsky.She is survived by her children, John in Belle River, Henry and Shelly in Florida and Kingsville, Mary Ann in Amherstburg, and Peter with his wife Nancy in Vancouver, Washington.

Predeceased by her much loved parents, Joyce Hamilton King Larkin (1999) and Richard Hamilton Larkin (2000). Joan attended Riverside High School and Ridley College. After attending the Ontario Police College in Aylmer, Ontario and graduating from the University of Windsor, Joan served with the Canada Border Security Agency until her retirement. She was a sports enthusiast her whole life and as a member of her high school track and field team, was fondly nicknamed "Joanie Javelin." But her great passion was baseball and the Miami Marlins were her team, win or lose. Joan also took up flying and in 1977 was very proud to have obtained her pilot's license, as her father and brother had done before her. Her maternal grandmother, Mrs. Muriel King, was also a great influence on Joan's love of cooking, whose recipes Joan saved and cherished. Joan had a quiet strength of character that gave her the ability to deal with and survive the many hardships that were tossed her way over the past few years. Everyone who had the chance to know her will remember – and miss Joan's great sense of humour and her gentleness of spirit. Our thanks to Drs. Wasserman and Mustafa, Hotel Dieu's overnight manager, Sue Marier and to all the nurses and nurse practitioners at Hotel Dieu who afforded Joan such respect during their care of her.

Eugene McNamara was born in Oak Park, Illinois on March 18, 1930. He attended De Paul University and received his PhD from Northwestern University, both in Chicago. He married the love of his life, Margaret, in 1952. After teaching at the University of Illinois, he moved his family to Windsor in 1959 to teach at what was then Assumption University, later the University of Windsor. He remained in the English Department for 36 years, retiring in 1995, and was named Professor Emeritus shortly thereafter. In 2000, he received the honorary degree of Doctor Of Laws from the University of Windsor. His accomplishments and contributions to the University and to the city of Windsor during those 36 years are tremendous. He spearheaded the Creative Writing Department which quickly became one of the most respected departments of its kind in Canada. He founded the "University of Windsor Review" and was its editor for over 20 years. He mentored numerous aspiring writers, many of whom went on to great success. He arranged poetry readings, not just at the university, but also in several locations across the city, putting Windsor on the map as a respected literary destination. He was a poet, a writer and a scholar. His numerous books, collections of poetry and short stories, drew praise from critics across the country. But the real passion in his career was teaching. He loved it all. He was and is one of the most beloved professors the University has ever had. Countless numbers of people have approached him or family members over the years to say that Dr. McNamara was the best professor they had ever had, that he inspired them to learn, to read, to love literature (and film – he created Literature in Film courses and shared his love of movies as a part-time film critic for the Windsor Star.) Many of his students became teachers themselves. Many went on to other pursuits, yet retained that love of books and the beauty that they found there. In 2008, a scholarship was established in his name. A dinner was held to honour him and to raise funds. Eugene was moved and proud but, in typical fashion for him, he was more excited about being able to give something to students in their academic pursuits than he was about the accolades he received that night. As much as he was proud of his contributions to the school and the city, Eugene was grateful to Windsor for providing him a place to learn and grow, a place to share his life with his darling wife and to raise and enjoy his family. He always said, "Windsor has been very good for me". He was a man who took great joy in the world and people around him, wringing every drop of happiness he could get out of his love of books, music, movies, art, antiques, cooking, travelling and dancing (he was a favourite partner at faculty and other parties because he was one of the few husbands who loved to dance). As immense as his love was for all of these, his greatest loves were his family, his friends and colleagues. Eugene was preceded in death by his mother Anna Ryan McNamara, his father, Joseph McNamara, his brother, Martin McNamara, as well as sons-in-law Patrick Lobzun, Kevin Donoghue and many friends and colleagues at the University of Windsor. He leaves, in body only, his wife, Margaret, oldest son Michael and his wife, Judy Holm; daughter, Mary, son David and his wife, Catharine Mastin, son Brian and his wife, Susan (nee Beaudoin); and son Christopher and his wife, Margaret Fong; grandchildren Aaron Holm and his wife, Saira Khan; Caitlin McNamara and her husband Neil Langshaw; Martin McNamara Lobzun; Jennifer McNamara; James and Jeffery Marr; Markus and August Fong-McNamara. Great-grandchildren Olive Holm, Haris Holm, and Joshua Hollywood. His love and spirit remain with them always. Each one of them knows and cherishes the enveloping warmth of his deep love for them. Heartfelt thanks to Margaret, Kahindi, Johnson, Ravi, Annette and all of the staff at CCAC and Paramed. Thanks also to Natalie and all the people at Home Instead. Many thanks also to Miles and John and all the good people at VON. The support of the palliative team at Hospice was invaluable. Finally, a very special thank you to two friends who are also nurses, Terry Whalen and Sarah Hill, who gave their expertise, along with their love and admiration for Eugene, in numerous ways. Memorial donations may be made to the Eugene McNamara Scholarship at The University of Windsor or, to carry on Eugene's love of literature, you may donate a book to a local school or library in your community. Cremation has taken place. Memorial visitation will take place on Tuesday, September 20, 2016 from 3 - 5 and 7 - 9 p.m. atFAMILIES FIRST1065 LAUZON RD.

Margaret (aka "Maggie", "Mags", "Margie","Marg Mo") was born in Windsor on the hospital steps of Hotel Dieu in 1957 despite the nun's admonition to her mother that she "could not do that here". That was Margaret: even from birth, a character larger than life. Margaret was a woman of many dimensions. She was gifted with intelligence and a passion and talent for many things. She was an Ontario championship squash player, tennis instructor, social worker, writer and editor (she never met a word she didn't like), with a quick and razor-sharp wit. A graduate of Vincent Massey High School, she continued to obtain degrees from both the University of Windsor and St. Clair College. Margaret was last employed in an editorial capacity by The Windsor Star, following journalism positions in Welland, Kirkland Lake and Elliot Lake. Margaret is survived by her brother, Fraser, of Kingsville and sister, Laurel, of Whitehorse and their children, and many wonderful and supportive friends. She is preceded in death by her father, Wilson ("Monty") Montrose and her mother, Dorothy Anne (nee Fraser), both of Windsor. If you so desire, donations to the Canadian Diabetes Association or the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario would be appreciated. As per Margaret's wishes, cremation has taken place.

Besides her parents, Norma was predeceased by her sister, Inez; her brother, Robert "Bobby"; and nephew, Quinn. Norma was proud of her Cape Breton roots and 'the best family' that she was born into. The hearty laughs shared with family meant the world to her, as did the fresh lobster flown in to Ontario over the years, and recently brought right to her bedside! A special thank you to Pauline and Marie for your immeasurable help. Thank you also to Norma and John's circle of friends. She shared many great stories over the years and was buoyed by the visits. Also a special thank you to her medical team, especially Dr. DeMarco, Dr. Kanjeekal and Dr. Freeman, and to Carol Derbyshire and the caring team at Hospice. Norma was grateful for and very much at peace under your care. Her optimistic attitude and fighting spirit carried her through her first battle with cancer over 30 years ago, and inspired her to become a door-to-door canvasser for the Canadian Cancer Society, and then into helping to establish the Windsor and Essex County Cancer Centre Foundation. She co-chaired the founding organization known as Friends of the Centre at the request of Dr. Hakam Abu Zahra, an oncologist at the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre where she received treatment. The foundation has improved the journey of thousands of local cancer patients. She was a passionate fund raiser and served as president for many years. She was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Law degree in 2008 from the University of Windsor for her contributions to the community and an Ontario Medical Association Centennial Award in recognition of achievements in service to the health and welfare of the people of Ontario. Norma always felt blessed with her family, lifelong friends, and those that helped her along the way. Thank you to all who have contributed over the years. May her path be an inspiration to us all.

Dana died peacefully surrounded by her family and friends following her eight-and-a-half year battle with cancer. She leaves behind her husband and rock, Paul, and her angel, her reason to fight as long and hard as she did, Isabella Kai. Dana is also survived by her mother Margaret Santavy; brothers Greg Santavy and his fiancée Leah Lee and Mark Santavy and his wife Mary Lynn; nephews Nathan, Brayden, and Chase; in-laws Mariano and Santina Brezzi; sister-in-law Patricia and her husband John Edmonson; and nieces Sara and Courtney. Dana was predeceased by her father Frank Santavy and nephew Tyson Santavy.While we grieve for this beautiful life taken too soon, our hearts overflow with gratitude that we were able to bear witness to the inspiring life she led. It has been a humble privilege and great blessing to share in this journey with her. Born in Chatham, Ontario, Dana was raised a Blenheim girl, complete with summers spent by the lake and culminating in her loss of the coveted Blossom Queen title. She went on to attend the University of Windsor, where she earned her Bachelor's degree in Communications and late-night border-crossing booze runs. She began her career at RM in 1995 and quickly became RM's head cheerleader and beloved snowflake of Rob Myers. Her career brought her around the world, including a quick stint as a California girl living in Santa Monica, and ultimately making her way home to meet the love of her life, Paul Brezzi. The two married in 2006 and gave birth to beautiful Isabella Kai in 2007.Dana's joyful spirit lit up every place she went and dazzled every person she met. Hundreds of people called her friend and thousands of people have been inspired by her story of hope in the midst of great challenge. In the short years she had, she taught us all to love without abandon, to live without fear, to celebrate today, to hope for the future, and to find joy in the everyday miracles of life.Dana was a vivacious soul, always planning a new adventure and ready to make new memories. She had an open heart and an open home, and she made everything beautiful. She was an incredible wife, mother, daughter, daughter-in-law, sister, aunt, and friend. She was the memory keeper for countless groups of friends, family, and soul sisters. She made friends everywhere she went, whether from the far corners of the globe or just across her hometown - and once you were a friend, you were a friend for life. She was the glue who held us all together over the years. To be loved by her was an enormous joy, and our lives are so much richer for having known her.Dana did not have the time here with us that we so hoped she would, but she did have just enough time to forever change the lives she touched.Visitation services will be held on Thursday, April 7, from 12:00–3:00 p.m. and 5:00–8:00 p.m. at The Armoury in Chatham at 44 William St. N.

Beloved husband of Adele (nee Schreyer) for 55 years, loving father of Chris Pawley (Kris Young- Tenn) and Charysse Pawley (George Mason), and proud grandfather of Scott, Katrina, Mitchell, Aislinn, Meaghan, Matthew and Mitchell. Howard will be missed by his brothers and sisters-in-law, Peter and Diane Schreyer, Edward (2014) and Irene Schreyer, Cecelia and Wilbert Klapprat, Lawrence Schreyer and Caroline and John (1983) Hull. Remembered by Lucas Smyk and Brittany Young-Tenn. Born in Brampton, Ontario, in 1934, Howard moved with his parents to Winnipeg, Manitoba at the age of seventeen. He started his first chapter of his working life practicing law in the Interlake of Manitoba in 1961. After several preparatory election campaigns, he was elected to the Manitoba Legislature as the New Democratic Party Member of the Legislature, representing the constituency of Selkirk from 1969 to 1988. His commitment to social democratic principles of economic and social justice and fairness for all was interwoven through the many legislative initiatives and political causes he championed both within and outside the Legislature. The Manitoba Public Insurance Act and the Marital Property Act are just two of the many changes made and introduced in the Legislature by Howard as Minister of Municipal Affairs and Attorney General of Manitoba. Following a change in government in 1977, and later, the resignation of Ed Schreyer as leader of the Manitoba NDP, Howard was elected Leader of the Party in November 1979. In 1981, after a successful election campaign, Howard became Premier of Manitoba. Most notable among his governments many accomplishments, were changes to human rights legislation, pay equity, worker and environmental protection, support for self government and improved conditions for First Nation, Métis and Inuit throughout Manitoba and Canada, strengthening family law, protecting children through changes to the child welfare system, reaffirming the rights of minorities, support for the multi-cultural fabric of the province and Canada and legislative protection of French language rights. The Pawley government also was widely recognized for its economic initiatives such as the Manitoba Jobs Fund, support for small and medium sized businesses throughout the Province and the utilization of Crown Corporations to provide services and bring economic returns to Manitoba. After the defeat of the NDP government in 1988, he briefly practiced law before turning to academia. The University of Windsor engaged him to teach in the departments of Political Science and the faculty of law. He was involved in politics at all levels as well served on the boards of various organizations at the federal, provincial and local level. His greatest joy was spending time with family, sharing their dreams and their accomplishments. The time spent camping in Western Canada with his children, cross country skiing at Hecla Island and travelling to different parts of Canada. He viewed his grandchildren as the future, writing his autobiography so that they could understand the importance of what he accomplished during his lifetime in making this a better world.

Esio's namesake was a Captain in the WW1 Italian cavalry who sent Esio's father, a teenager at the time, to safety, away from a battlefield in which the Captain himself perished.Uptown Radio's Frank Ewasyshyn Sr. mentored Esio's youthful interest in electronics. During his working life, Esio completed electronics education, then Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral degrees at Wayne State University, focusing on Industrial Engineering, Communications and Education. He continued learning throughout his life, in the belief that education provides one with the ability to choose, to "bargain with fate." Following technical work in television at CKLW Windsor, CTV Winnipeg, and CBC Ottawa, Esio became the founding Director of the Media Centre at the University of Windsor where he later was Head of the Communication Studies Department and Professor until his retirement in 1997. Esio's expertise was in video production, the use of technology in education, and organizational administration. Esio's talents in teaching included the creative use of stories and examples to illustrate strategies, concepts, and theories. He modelled appropriate career demeanor and facilitated the early careers of many students by mentoring students and establishing internships. Professional memberships were with APEO (P.Eng.) and SMPTE Detroit. Based on his expertise, he joined the technical team at the 1976 Montreal Olympics and he was appointed to develop a Centre for Educational Technology at the first university in Oman, 1986-88.Esio was a leader in many service organizations, and became a Windsor Rotarian in 1978, transferring to Lions Gate North Vancouver Rotary in 1999, where he held club offices including club President and was Assistant District Governor. Esio was a multiple Paul Harris Fellow and was a tenacious leader in the development of a Youth Safe House in North Vancouver, also President of the International Skiing Fellowship of Rotarians (ISFR) 2011-2013 and President of North Shore Probus 2008-2009. Esio was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012 for community involvement.To his cherished family and friends, Esio was kind, generous, optimistic, classy, intellectual and practical. He often initiated discussions, challenging others with new ideas. Esio lived according to the concept that if your basic necessities are met, you can be as happy as you choose to be. Esio spent time in many countries on six continents, finding that experience in other cultures increases understanding of oneself. A regular golfer, wine maker, and multiple deck-builder, he began alpine skiing in mid-life, continuing into his 80s.Esio bore his final illness (pancreatic cancer) with stoical courage, patience, pragmatism, dignity, some humour and even academic curiosity. Furry felines were good lap company for much needed rest.Esio was the loving confidante, fellow learner, traveler, and beloved partner for nearly 30 years of Margaret Landstrom, and loyal brother of Tito (Serafina) and Lillian (Otto Valvasori, late). Esio will be remembered fondly by Margaret's daughters, Laura (Rob Tatic) and Janet (Ben Jackson) and their families. He will also be remembered by former wife and good friend Kathleen Marzotto, her sister Maureen Cisilino, and many nieces and nephews. Predeceased by parents Antonio and Giuseppina Marzotto, and sister Elsie (Phil Gava, also late). Esio will be missed also by Margaret's siblings, Jim Adamson (June) and Catherine Ruskin, his and Margaret's extended families, as well as friends, university colleagues, Rotarians and fellow ISFR members.Esio instructed that there be no funeral. In Esio's honour, you might donate to charities he assisted: the North Shore Youth Safe House c/o Hollyburn.ca, or the Polio eradication program of Rotary International, or support pancreaticcancercanada.ca. Remember Esio best with a toast of good (Italian) wine, and/or plant a tree in his honour, adding to the many he established during his lifetime.		t	NULL	NULL	42.3	-83.03

Our paterfamilias, he also leaves his children David and Amy; Larry and Julie; Eric and Tara; Mike and Debbie; Rolf and Corrin; Kirsten and Joel; and Sash and Kerry. Beloved "Grandpa", Carl is survived by his many grandchildren who were a great source of pride for him. Born in Birmingham Alabama, Carl was raised on Detroit's west side before coming to Windsor. He was the quintessential Renaissance Man with multiple undergraduate and graduate degrees in theology and classical studies, and a PhD from the University of Michigan. Upon retirement, he resurrected one of his life's passions, completing a BFA in visual art. He was a lifelong teacher through positions at Lutheran Colleges in Baltimore and St. Louis, a long career as a Classics professor at the University of Windsor, his seminars on rugs, coins and stamps, and his own Fiesta Bridge Club. Carl was an antique enthusiast, a coin and stamp collector, an avid reader and movie watcher, and a wonderful cook. Infinitely patient, he spent time perfecting his orchids and was a fixture in his backyard garden where he cultivated vegetables for anyone who happened to visit. Carl epitomized scholar, not only in his formal education, but in all aspects of his astounding life. When he became interested in a topic or a hobby, he developed an almost instantaneous expertise. His wisdom and experience cannot be replaced, but will be his legacy in the many lives he touched.

Brother-in-law of David (Karen) Steindorf. Survived also by many beloved nieces and nephews, great-nieces and nephews, friends and students. Daniel was a Bavarian by descent, American by birth and Canadian by choice. He always knew he wanted to pursue a career in art, and received his BFA in Painting/Printmaking from Layton School of Art and his MFA in Printmaking from Cranbrook Academy of Art. In the middle of his time at Cranbrook he was drafted by the US Army to serve during the Vietnam War, but even then Daniel was recognized as a talented artist and served for two years as an Army illustrator. Once he received his honourable discharge, he completed his studies at Cranbrook. To say Daniel began teaching at the University of Windsor in 1970 would be an understatement. He not only established the Lithography Department in the School of the Visual Arts, he also established the first papermaking courses in Canada. He has taught courses in Italy, Germany, Spain, the United States, and throughout Canada. Daniel's artwork is included in many private and public collections. A multitude of his work has been featured in exhibits in Canada, the United States, Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, Ghana, Holland, Iceland, Jamaica, South Africa, Japan and Sweden. Daniel also has had major, one-person shows at the Art Gallery of Windsor, the Munich Opera House, Rodman Hall Art Centre at St. Catherine's, and the Boston Museum School. Daniel was larger than life and self-proclaimed "Master of the Overdone". His great loves were his family, friends, students, and teaching.

Joffe August 20, 1947-September 20, 2014 David Joffe passed away on Saturday, September 20, 2014 following a brief but brave battle with lymphoma.David was raised in Windsor, Ontario by Alec and Sarah (Fine) Joffe. He started his working career as a young boy selling peanuts in Mitchell Park. After eight hours, $2.10 and sunstroke he realized it was not a lucrative venture and switched to selling ice-cream quadrupling his earnings in half the time.In 1964 he joined Chrysler Canada Limited as a repair man on the assembly line. With a wife and two young children by the age of 21, he realized that he had to advance his career and with the encouragement of teachers and professors, he returned to complete his education as a part-time student and graduated from the University of Windsor in 1972 with sociology and economics majors. He remained at Chrysler but moved into Labour Relations management.From 1980-84 he was with Kaiser Aluminum Chemical Limited before joining the Oshawa Group Limited as Director of Labour Relations. He was promoted to Vice-President, Industrial Relations in June 1990, becoming a supreme master at negotiating collective agreements, mediating and arbitrating. While he worked most of his life on the management side of the bargaining table a former Canadian Director of a major Union stated that "David was respected by Union representatives because of his understanding of both sides in the adversarial approach and respect for working people."He was dubbed "a worthy adversary", and was an exceptional student of human behaviour and the human psyche. He never forgot the lessons he learned on the auto assembly line, the shop floor or the school of hard knocks. In the business of labour relations they served him well in achieving a brilliant career.In 1997 David ventured out on his own setting up a consulting company that provided Labour and Employee Relations consulting services to private sector clients, and in 2012 he was appointed as a Mediator/Arbitrator to the Ontario Ministry of Labour. This appointment was his dream come true and his ultimate challenge. He dedicated his time to providing the highest possible calibre of decision to each case he heard.Those who knew him well understood that his handshake was his promise cast in stone. Those who he mentored say that not only was their time working under his guidance the most valuable of their lives but also consolidated a lifetime friendship. The young members of his family looked to him for guidance. Whether or not they liked it, they knew he was right.He researched anything and everything he could lay his hands on. An acute interest in history and politics combined with his avid reading led to lively discussions among his peers. His creativity was expressed and fulfilled when he researched, designed and oversaw the building of the family home - a place he never wanted to leave, nor did. He became a superb chef to the joy of his family who demolished his expansive meals. He loved the camaraderie of his friends, whether it was golfing, the football pool, riding his Harley, or sipping on espressos in the back yard - he thrived in their presence.Although he often tried to hide it, David was deeply human with enormous compassion. He brought humour, passion and zest for life to everything he did. His big laugh is etched on all our minds. Dave will be sorely missed by all who had the joy of knowing him.He is survived by his wife Marilu (nee Sutton), his daughter and son, Dana and Aaron, his grandchildren AJ, Justin, Sara and Noah, and his great-granddaughter Lucia.		t	NULL	NULL	42.3	-83.03

Devoted brother of the late Gloria Tuck (1995).Dick enjoyed duck hunting, fishing, bird-watching and everything outdoors. He was a life-long amateur hockey player and was pleased to be the Captain at one time of the Bendo Blazers. Dick had a wonderful sense of humour and was a great story teller, with stories on growing up, growing wise and growing old. We often relied on his wise counsel. He achieved a lifelong dream by earning his private pilot's license and shared his love of flying with his son Robert.Dick earned a B.A. from Assumption College (now University of Windsor) in 1952, and the equivalent of an LLB from Osgoode Hall Law School, Toronto, in 1956. He practiced with McTague, Clark; Holden, McMahon, Zuber & Thrasher and Holden, Zuber, Bondy & Cusinato, retiring in 2000 as the lead counsel of Bondy, Riley, Koski, Stewart. His 44-year law practice focused on municipal law, representing many local municipalities, including the Town of LaSalle and the County of Essex. For 16 years he was a part-time Deputy-Judge for the Small Claims Court. He defied the odds after a debilitating stroke in 2004 by recovering enough to walk, drive and even return to work at the Court.He was a voracious reader of almost any topic. He loved travelling in North America, especially northern Ontario, and ultimately where ever there might be an ice cream shop at the end of the road. He was a loving husband, father and grandfather, a leader and a good friend to many people. We will all miss him. Many blessings, peace and happiness be yours, Richard.Cremation has taken place.

Her 92 years of life were richly filled with family and friends and a lifelong pursuit of many interests and hobbies. She is survived by her children Susan (Robert), Robert (Shirley), Kenn (Patti), Don (Connie) and Jim (Sancha); and by her sister, Joyce Walker. Her eldest son, Jon (Lee Ann), passed away in 2011. A happy grandmother, June was very proud of her many grandchildren, Ian, Kevin, Evan and Colin (Jon's children); Virgil, Jessica and Caleb (Susan's children); Courtney and Shawn (Robert's children); Branden, Kyle and Erica (Don's children) and Robbie (Jim's child). June lived through the Great Depression and stoically sent her sweetheart off to World War II. Although accepted to the Ontario College of Art, June started work at the Westinghouse plant in Hamilton in the drafting department immediately after high school, and over her tenure became Supervisor of the Drafting Room. They wed upon Fred's return and moved to Essex to work and raise their family. Fred and June were an outgoing couple who loved to entertain and made fast friends wherever they were. June was very artistic and there was always some craft project on the go, whether it was a school project for the kids, drawings for her art classes, and sock monkeys for the Kinnettes or Christmas decorations; she loved Christmas! She also followed her passion for the arts and attended the University of Windsor's Fine Art Programme on a part time basis. After Fred retired, they moved to their summer cottage at Invercairn Beach near Forest for their permanent home and wintered in Florida - a snowbird's dream. Summers were filled with grandchildren and gardens, and winters with visitors, lawn bowling and every craft under the sun. June lent her artistic talents to pottery, wood carving, flower making, jewellery, clocks and also led Fred to discover how much he enjoyed creating artworks and being with her. They were married for 63 years, truly for better or worse, in sickness and in health. The family would like to thank Kenn and Patti for their devoted care of June and the staff at Avondale Residence in Toronto who took such good care of her. Memorial Service will be held at Hillsboro Cemetery, 7995 Hillsboro Road, (near Forest Ontario and the family cottage "Invercairn Beach" community) at 2:00 p.m. Saturday, August 24.

A beautiful service attended by family and friends was held in San José. Afterwards, at Bill's request, his cremation took place. He was born William Robert Delaney on August 2nd, 1930 in Toronto, Ontario. Bill will reunite with his parents Arthur Delaney (1972) and Velma (Arnott)(2003) along with his brother Paul Delaney (1963). He will be forever missed by his loving wife Lilliana (Chaves) with whom he shared 22+ years of love and marriage. Cherished father to his 5 children: daughter Joann LeHoux and husband Roger of Belle River, daughter Roseanne Evans and partner George Pesut of Victoria B.C., son Michael Delaney and wife Pennie of Windsor, daughter Marianne Muzzatti and husband Bud (William) of Puce, and son Michael Chaves Delaney and partner Elysia Wismer of Sudbury. Loving Papa to his 9 grandchildren: Kelly McCain Blair and husband Gary of Toronto, Jordan Evans and fiancé Liz Gallo of Victoria B.C., Sean Evans and wife Galena (Campbell) of Vancouver B.C., Michelle Delaney MacNeil and husband John of LaSalle, Paul Delaney of Edmonton, Alberta, Shannon Delaney of Windsor, Lauren Muzzatti, William Muzzatti, and Olivia Muzzatti of Puce. Great Grandpa to Mia Blair, Johnny and Cara Evans, and baby (Emi) Evans, due in May. Bill grew up Irish Catholic, in Toronto's West end. He attended St. "Mike's" High School/ College where he played the trumpet in the school band, and was an Air Cadet. Like his forefathers, the military was in his blood and Bill, in his own words, "developed a fondness for being in uniform and the structure that went with it". He married and eventually moved to Windsor with his wife, Patricia (Barron), in the early 50's. Not long after, Bill became one of "Windsor's Finest" and started a distinguished 31 year career with the Windsor Police. The first half of his career was in uniform, where early on, he loved "walking the beat" on Drouillard Road and in Downtown Windsor, in the days of no portable radios and "call boxes". He also policed by motorcycle year round and it was during those early years, that Bill really fell in love with "the city". The remaining half of his career, Bill became a Special Investigations Detective specializing in Child Abuse and Family Violence and occasionally partnered with the R.C.M.P. Bill served on several committees: The Sexual Assault Crisis Centre, Case Review Team, The Roman Catholic Children's Aid Society, and also lectured on occasion at The University of Windsor along with many other organizations and institutions. Over his career, Bill was honored in Letters of Commendations, and awards, along with a medal for bravery. Bill retired from the Windsor Police in 1987 but soon after, started back to work with The Roman Catholic Children's Aid Society as Police Liaison and Consultant from 1987 to 1989. Along with his knowledge and expertise in police relations, and the years he worked as a liaison with Brentwood, Bill brought a unique combination of "person" and experience to the R.C.C.A.S. agency. Bill also served on the Board of Directors for Brentwood Recovery Home from 1984 to 1988. He was a proud alumni of 32 years. He and Fr. Charbonneau were good friends and his experience there put him in a good position to help other officers and friends. During Bill's "off time" he worked/volunteered with the American Embassy in San Jose, Costa Rica, on their "Alcoholism Panel" with the Mental Health Department, along with setting up new group meetings, or joining existing ones wherever he traveled or lived. True to his Irish heritage and his love of Ireland, "Wild Bill", as he was affectionately known amongst old friends, was also President of the Overseas Irish Club from 1967 to 1973 and enjoyed many trips to the Emerald Isle where he had family, friends and deep roots. Bill was often described as "charming" which our family attributed to his "Irish Plamas", a Gaelic term meaning "a gifted and natural ability to engage people with kind words". His later years were spent traveling, spending treasured time at home with family and friends, and was always with a good book on the go. Bill's smiling Irish eyes, along with his warm and generous heart and wonderful sense of humour, will be fondly remembered and cherished. He will be greatly missed by his loved ones and many good friends, especially Sam D, Tom F, Dr. John, Don T, and in Costa Rica, Ray H.

Surrounded by his family, Sandy died peacefully in the Cardiac Care Unit at Hotel Dieu Grace Hospital where he was cared for, after a sudden heart attack, with expertise and compassion for which his family will be forever grateful. Sandy's was born in Sarnia, Ontario, shortly before he and his parents moved to Windsor, where he was soon joined by his only sibling, Dave (Dublin, Ireland). In his mid-twenties, he met Marilyn Pyne (2006) who was for 50 years the love of his life. Sandy is survived by their sons, Scott (Nathalie and their children Victoria and Samuel) and Jeff (Lisa and their children, Corey, Joshua and Brooke) and by Scarlett, the daughter of Joshua and his wife Jenn. Sandy will be fondly remembered, too, by many nieces, nephews, cousins and sister- and brothers-in-law and among the too-many-to name, especially close friends mourning Sandy's loss are his like-a- daughter Judy (Montgomery) and her husband Larry Trealout. From a backyard beginning in 1969, Sandy and Marilyn built their company, Splendor Pools, helping thousands throughout Windsor-Essex to years of family fun and making a host of friends along the way. Customers often visited long after their pool purchase, not just to buy pool supplies but also to enjoy Sandy's jokes and chat. A celebration of Sandy's life will be held at 2:30 p.m., Sunday, April 14 in the Collavino Hall of the WCFCU Centre (Windsor Arena) complex northeast of the intersection of Tecumseh Rd E and Lauzon Rd. (Cremation has already taken place.) One of Sandy's greatest pleasures was hockey and he was so thrilled with the Spitfires' two Memorial Cups. He was a Windsor Spitfires (and predecessors) season ticket holder for 50 years and to mark that treasured aspect of his life, as requested in his final wishes, those attending the celebration are encouraged to wear their favourite hockey jerseys. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to endowment funds being established in Sandy's memory. Details of the endowments are being arranged with the University of Windsor, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada and in consultation with the Windsor Spitfires; all donations will be tax-deductible. The University of Windsor endowment donations will be directed to either the existing Marilyn Wilson Nursing Scholarship Fund (Sandy's late wife was a nurse), which may be renamed the Marilyn and Sandy Wilson Nursing Scholarship Fund, or to a similar scholarship endowment fund in Sandy's name alone. The Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada endowment, which will be named in Sandy's memory, will provide for his Windsor Spitfires season tickets to be used by a Little Brother/Sister and his/her "BIG". It's being arranged as a model to encourage similar endowments in other CHL team cities. The endowment being arranged with advice from the Windsor Spitfires will provide for a player award in Sandy's name at either the Windsor Spitfires or OHL level.

Gene will be sadly missed by his wife of 53 years Elizabeth (Pollinger), and his three daughters, Terry and husband Joe Dupont, Susan Whelan, Cathy and husband Brian Molloy; his granddaughter Katie Dupont; and his step-granddaughters Stephanie, Samantha and Shelby Molloy, extended family and many friends.Eugene Whelan was born on July 11, 1924 in Anderdon Township, Ontario the son of Charles B. Whelan and Frances L. Kelly, and was the last surviving of nine children. He was educated in Anderdon Township, Amherstburg and Walkerville, Ontario. Survived by his aunts Helen Wrynn, Blanche Kelly also his brothers and sister-in-law Lena (late Peter) Uzun, Adolf (late Barbara) Hoffman, Martin (Judi) Pollinger.Gene, fondly known as "The Senator" to many, was a proud Canadian, deeply devoted to his country and fellow citizens.He served on the local Separate School Board at the age of 21, moved on to Township Council and the Essex County road committee in the 1950s, was Reeve of Anderdon Township and was elected as Warden of Essex County in 1962.He also held a number of positions including Director and President of the Harrow Farmers Co-op, Director of the United Co-operatives of Ontario, the Co-operators Insurance Co. and the Ontario Winter Wheat Producers Marketing Board. He was also President of the Essex County branch, and Board Member of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture.He was first elected to the House of Commons in 1962, as a member of the Liberal Party and re-elected in all subsequent federal elections until 1984, when he retired. In 1972, he was appointed Federal Minister of Agriculture, a position he held until 1984, except for a brief hiatus in 1979.As Minister he was instrumental in the creation of numerous programs in support of the growth of primary production and agribusiness in Canada, and especially supply management.In addition to his work for Canadians, Eugene was active internationally through the World Food Program, was President of the World Food Council, and led the Canadian Delegations to the United Nations Pledging Conference in New York for five years.He hosted important international conferences in Canada and represented the Canadian government on numerous bi-lateral missions around the world. He led the way to normalization of relations with China by taking a delegation on agricultural cooperation there.As Minister of Agriculture he visited the U.S.S.R. on agricultural exchange missions and understood the problems facing that society. When Mikhail Gorbachev, who later became the President of the new Soviet Union, came to Canada on a Minister-to-Minister visit, Gene was able to proudly show him the many advantages for a nation in providing incentive for productivity. Not so long after, Russia changed fundamentally and the Wall came down.Eugene's career in public service has been acknowledged in many ways. In 1976, he became an Honourary Colonel of the 21st (Windsor) Service Battalion and upon his retirement from that position, he was awarded the Canadian Forces Decoration for his dedicated service. In 1983, he received an Honourary Doctorate of Law degree from the University of Windsor in recognition of his valuable contributions as a public servant. The Ontario Institute of Agrologists and the Agricultural Institute of Canada conferred their Honourary Life Memberships on Senator Whelan for his commitment, leadership and contributions to agriculture on a national and international level. He received the prestigious Freedom Award in 1986 from The Windsor/Detroit International Freedom Festival for his outstanding contributions to the cause of freedom and peace and was also the recipient of the Queen's Jubilee Medal. Senator Whelan was inducted into the Canadian, Ontario and Essex County Agriculture Halls of Fame.Senator Whelan, "The Great Canadian Farmer," was made an officer of the Order of Canada in 1987. Gene was summoned to serve in the Canadian Senate in 1996. He was an active Senator and served as Deputy-Chair of the Agriculture and Forestry Committee. He was a member of several Senate committees and sub-committees until his retirement from the Senate in 1999.Among Gene's many accomplishments, some of those of which he was most proud include a number of local projects and initiatives. In the early 1980s, along with his Cabinet colleagues, the Right Honourable Herb Gray and the Honourable Mark MacGuigan, Gene played an important role in preventing the downfall of the Chrysler Corporation and also made new investments by Ford possible with help from the federal government. He was also able to help with numerous community projects, and was very proud of Amherstburg's King's Navy Yard Park and the K. Walter Ranta Marina as well as the Belle River Marina, to name just a few.But perhaps what Eugene was most proud of was the fact that he was able to help literally thousands of individual constituents with issues of all sorts affecting them and their families. Gene loved to help and to serve, and he has left a tremendous legacy that will outlive him for many years to come.He will be fondly remembered for what he's done and for who he was – a wise, informed, sincere, colourful, non-judgemental gentleman and activist who wanted everyone to have meaningful opportunities.

A passionate, humourous man with endless enthusiasm for, and a love of, music, learning, research, and a good conversation. Loving and cherished dad of Daniel, Sofia, and Danica, son of Colleen and the late Larry (2012), brother of Lisa and husband Av Maharaj, Leslie and husband David Boutet, Daniella and husband Kevin Brown, and the late Ryan Kathleen (1996), loving partner of Melissa Noventa, long-time friend of Bernardo Padron, and a cherished friend to so many others. Also he will be deeply missed by his many nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Michael was a Professor of Music, as well as an Associate Professor in the Faculty of Education, at York University. Prior to joining the full-time faculty at York University, Michael taught for ten years at the university and secondary school levels and in community settings in Windsor, Toronto and California. He was a graduate of F.J. Brennan high school, the University of Windsor (BMus), and York University (BEd and PhD). Michael was a performer, arranger, composer, ethnomusicologist and a teacher with vast experience in classical, jazz, Cuban, Latin, and popular music. He served as a graduate student advisor to many who describe him as a completely devoted and formative educator, brilliant, quick witted, and above all, generous with his time. A man of many hats, who fought the bigger battles to lessen the load of others. Michael joined the Regent Park School of Music (Toronto) in 2011 and its program flourished directly due to his countless volunteer hours and relentless spirit to ensure children had access to music education. He performed with symphony orchestras in Windsor, Detroit and Mississauga and as a freelance trumpeter with numerous artists in Canada, U.S. and Cuba. His credits as an arranger and composer include work with the Canadian Brass, University of Memphis Jazz Orchestra, and Toronto-based Latin ensembles Orquesta Fantasia and Pacande. He was a global authority on both Cuban popular music and Afro-Cuban sacred music, lecturing and publishing around the world. He collaborated in curating the Afro-Cuban exhibit of The Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) in Phoenix, Arizona, and later became a valued consultant for their Latin American gallery. Special thanks to the doctors and nurses at Princess Margaret Hospital, Beth Reid at the CCAC and all the wonderful help she put in place, and Dr. Gall and the Hospice staff for the gift of their time for Michael.

After working in New York City, he pursued higher studies in Paris from 1935 to 1939 at the Sorbonne, while teaching English at the Jesuit college in Versailles and serving as a guide for British and American tourists. Dr. Thibault met his future wife, Mary Marshall, of New York City, in Paris where she was also studying French. They were married in 1940. Following further studies at Harvard University and teaching at Tilton Academy, NH, Dr. Thibault worked for the Army during World War II, coordinating logistical operations for the port of Boston and debriefing enemy prisoners of war.

She leaves behind a grief-stricken family; her husband Murray, truly the love of her life, her daughter Elizabeth, in whose love and devotion she revelled, and her mother Dorothy Fitch, to whom she was as close as only a truly devoted child could be. She is also survived by her stepson, David O'Neil, and stepdaughter, Debra Gallaugher. She was predeceased by her younger son Andrew, who tragically died three months ago, and by her father, Lorne Fitch, who passed away in 1973. Judy was born and raised in the Windsor area, she obtained an RN degree - Grace Hospital - 1962, and a Public Health Nursing Diploma - University of Windsor - 1965. She was instrumental in setting up the first Public Health System for personnel at Hotel-Dieu Hospital. In her second career, she realized her long-time passion for interior decorating and was also very proud of earning her private pilot's license. Her life, however, was devoted mainly to the rearing of her children, her always loving support for her husband and her mother, and the constant care and beautification of her home. After successfully persevering through treatment for breast cancer in 1992 and again in 2000, she became much involved with volunteer work at the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre. Her warm, outgoing nature ensured she had a host of friends ranging from her bowling teammates to cancer survivors in need of the succour she so freely and effectively provided. Judy was also a loyal and devoted member of the Lakeshore St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church. She will be sorely missed by many, she can never be replaced. Judy will be resting at the Walter D.

I was born in Fort William, ON and moved to Port Arthur at the age of 12. Now, it is all called Thunder Bay. I moved away from home and graduated from University of Windsor in 1966 and was promptly employed by McLeod Young Weir (now ScotiaMcLeod). I worked there for over 45 years, until the day I died. Loyalty, a love of people, and leadership were some of my qualities. I loved my career (I didn't call it a job), but it did not define me. I started in Toronto, where I met my wife, Pat, and moved to Windsor in 1974 to become branch manager there. The plan was to stay for five years, but we never left. It was in Windsor where we raised our children, Paul & Sonya, rode the heady days of the 80's, survived the crash of 1987, and was semi-retired for the past several years. I joined Beach Grove G&CC in 1975, served on the Hotel Dieu Hospital Board, the Art Gallery of Windsor Foundation, and Our Lady of Guadalupe Church finance committee. I was also very supportive of Pat in all her various volunteer activities, whether they were popular or not. Support and service were other qualities of mine. I made sure that my children had all the opportunities of success (education, values, work experience, community involvement) while giving them the freedom to follow the paths of their choice. Despite the busyness of the financial world, I always made time to participate in Paul & Sonya's activities, even if it meant becoming a soccer coach without ever having played the game. I also was treasurer for the 44th Scout Group for 15 years. I enjoyed supporting local sports teams, was present for the Maple Leafs winning the Stanley Cup in 1967 (I was always a Red Wings fan), the Tigers winning the World Series in 1984, and watched the Pistons and Red Wings win multiple championships. I also enjoyed staying active and social, playing golf, curling and bowling, being a member of the Ford Boulevard Bowling Association since my arrival in Windsor. I didn't get my first passport until 15 years ago, but since then Pat and I have travelled extensively throughout the world, and always treasured our winter holidays in Barbados. I am survived by my beloved wife and best friend, Pat, adored by my children Paul (Marilyne) in Quebec City and Sonya (Eric Coatsworth) in Ottawa and devoted to my grandchildren, William, Jakob and Jolyanne. I am also survived by my mother, Stella and my brother, John (Sally) in Thunder Bay, my sister Pat (Larry Miller) in Sault Ste Marie, my brother-in-law, Ross Robinson in Niagara-on-the-Lake and my nieces and nephews, Mike, Kathy, Lori, Jeff, Susan, Scott and Carrie. I am also lovingly remembered by many cousins, colleagues, neighbours and friends. According to them, 71 years is not long enough, but there was nothing left unsaid or undone. I will be remembered as a man who was passionate about my family, my work, my community and people in general. My thanks to the doctors and staff at Hotel Dieu Grace ICU for their compassion and care. In lieu of flowers, donations are requested to the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario - Windsor Region Branch, the Windsor Symphony Orchestra, the Art Gallery of Windsor or the Windsor Downtown Mission. I will be cremated at my request.

Steve was born and raised in Windsor; his parents, Helen and Daniel, were hard working immigrants from Hungary and were proud that both Steve and his older brother Aurel became doctors. Steve had many fond memories of the University of Western Ontario, where not only did he complete his medical and surgical training (MD, 1959), but also met Dorothy Torrance, the operating room nurse who became the love of his life. He was a caring surgeon in the city of Windsor for 36 years (1966-2002); incredibly committed (many times in the middle of the night waking up and racing to the hospital to perform emergency surgery, and remarkably always in good spirits to greet his children the next morning), Steve was equally well known for his surgical aptitude. Indeed, he was the first surgeon in Ontario to successfully re-implant an amputated hand, and also introduced neonatal surgery to Windsor, successfully operating on infants weighing as little as 2 lbs. Dr. Radin was Chief of Surgery for 17 years, first at Windsor Regional Hospital and then at Grace Hospital, where he was well loved by the nurses and staff for his kindness. Steve is a past President of the Essex County Medical Society as well as the Southwestern Ontario Surgical Association. Steve was also interested in sports medicine, having served as a ring-side physician in both boxing and wrestling; in particular he was a member of the Canadian delegation in the 1972 and 1976 Olympics - one of Steve's most cherished moments was walking into the Olympic stadium with the Canadian Olympic Team as a physician at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Ever since his childhood the church has held a very important place in Steve's heart; beginning with the active participation of Steve's parents in Windsor's Romanian church, as an adult he went on to 30 years of active membership in Temple Baptist Church, and then became an active member of Banwell Community Church. He was Chair of the Board of Trustees of Temple Baptist Church for 19 years and was a Sunday School teacher for 12 years of those years. Steve continually contributed to his community. He served with the Victorian Order of Nurses (VON) in Windsor-Essex County over the last 40 years: first as a medical advisor, then as a member of the Board of Directors, and finally as President of the Endowment Foundation. He also served on the Board of Governors of the University of Windsor and the Board of Trustees of the McMaster University Divinity School. Dr. Radin put his surgical skills to good use in some of the poorest parts of the world through volunteering as a surgeon in mission hospitals in India, Nepal, and China. A Memorial Service will be held at Banwell Community Church, 2400 Banwell Road, Windsor, at 11am on Saturday, March 27, 2010.

Five weeks ago our dad courageously confronted the "fight of his life". As he did with everything that he took on, he faced his passing with, class, strength, dignity and his undaunted sense of humour. He passed away at London University Hospital with friends and family by his side at 2:45 a.m. on December 12, 2009. Our father leaves behind a loving family and a lifetime of beautiful memories for us, his children Hilary and Graham (Michelle), his wife and our stepmother Diane Abbey, his grand-daughter Emily, our mother Sharon Abbey (Fred), his stepson Anthony Istl (Jenn), and many cherished friends, colleagues and members of his extended family. Our dad is pre-deceased by his parents Bruce and Christine Abbey. He grew up in Welland, Ontario and attended Ridley College in St. Catharines. After graduating with his B.A. from The University of Toronto (Victoria College) in 1962, he went on to receive his L.L.B from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1965. He was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1967 after receiving The Admiralty Prize in the Bar Admissions Course . From 1967-69 he served as an associate with Campbell, Godfrey and Lewtas in Toronto where he practiced Admiralty Law and general litigation. From 1969-71 he was Junior Counsel to the late J.T. Weir, QC at Weir & Foulds in Toronto. In 1971 our father moved to St. Catharines with his family where he was a sole practitioner (1972-73). From there he was a partner with Wilson, Miller, Fullerton, Partington, Robins and Abbey (1973-80). In December 1980 he was appointed a Queen's Counsel. Our dad continued to practice law as a partner with Partington, Abbey & Wormold (1980-1984) until he was appointed a judge of the Provincial Court (Family Division) in Windsor, Ontario (1984). From there he went on to be appointed as a judge of The District Court of Ontario (The Ontario Superior Court of Justice) in 1990. During his long and storied judicial career our dad held many significant positions inclu-ding local Administrative Judge for The Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Windsor (2004-2005) and Vice-President of The Ontario Family Court Judges' Assoc-iation (1989-1990). Our father was most proud of his position as a guest lecturer at The Faculty of Law, University of Windsor (1985 to present) and his status as founder and honorary member of The Sage Brush Club. During his illustrious career our father had many other professional accomplishments. What was most important to him was that persons involved in the court system be treated with dignity and respect. He was highly regarded within the judicial system, not only because of his legal acumen, but because of his innate sense of compassion and justice. He will be missed by all those involved in the administration of justice in Ontario. We will proudly remember our father for his sense of humour, his unconditional love and his wise counsel. We are honoured to be his children. Our father is our hero and always will be. "Hi-yo, Silver, away!" We love you dad! Our dad's eyes were donated to provide the gift of sight.

She was the daughter of Hon. Paul I. Staniszewski and Wanda Marie Boguslawska (d.1969) and sister of Camille Hankie, Vancouver, B.C., Michelle Bevan, Langley, B.C. and Andrea Charlton, Essex, ON. She also leaves many nieces, a nephew and cousins. Gayle was born in Toronto where she spent her early years with her grandmother, Babcia Boguslawski learning the love of nature, the Polish language, high ethical standards but most important she learned to love unconditionally. After the death of her mother, the family moved to Windsor where she attended Riverside Secondary School and later the University of Windsor where she majored in the Fine Arts program. Since 1982, she had been employed by Canada Post where she designed an extraordinary and speedy method of postal delivery known as 'Gayle Mail'. Gayle's artistic talents were widely recognized through her skills as a photographer and videographer. She was a member of the Canadian Historical Aircraft Association and her outstanding videos of air shows have been shown nationally. As well she had the high honour of riding with the Canadian Forces Snowbirds (Snowbird #5) and produced a video of the ride. She was a committed environmentalist who quietly and freely volunteered many years of her life to protecting animals and wildlife habitat in Essex County. She had assisted Erie Wildlife in the daily care of their injured animals as well as those she tended at her own home. She was on the Board of Directors of the Essex County Field Naturalists Club and participated in several important projects including the collection of indigenous native seeds many of which are now saplings ready to be planted. She joined early in the successful effort to protect Marshfield Woods, a provincially and globally significant wetland habitat in Essex County. She produced videos from the air showing the natural wildlife linkages and corridors in the county which need environmental protection. Gayle was also an amateur genealogist who used her skills at tracing ancestry for searching Ontario provincial archives for land grants, maps and ownership records of environmentally important areas in Essex County. Her documentary evidence was significant in major Ontario environmental law cases. Gayle was a quiet person of concern, commitment, and compassion who preferred to work behind the scenes. She was caring, upbeat, creative and optimistic to the end. Like most people, she made no headlines. But the Spirit, especially compassion, that she expressed and the ways she did so are the goodness which supports the real world, beyond name or fame. Such lives given to freely caring for and showing compassion to others, especially wildlife, are among the highest human legacies.Our heartfelt thanks to the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre, especially 4th Floor Oncology and Dr. A. Hammer, for all the kindness, advice and assistance given to Gayle during her final days. Special thanks to Dr. Y. Alam and Dr. C. Leighton, Donna Danelon, Clinical Dietician and Supportive Care and the nurses and staff in the Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy Suites. We thank also Dr. M. Moore and Dr. S. Gallinger at The Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Dr. Denis Marier, Canadian Clinic for Integrative Medicine and to Dr. L.A. Strausz for many years of behind the scene support. We are especially grateful to Dr. Y. Alam for her long time deeply caring and supportive assistance to Gayle. Through this journey of over ten years, Gayle always felt comforted that Dr. Alam would continue with creative options no matter how difficult the situation- and she did. Arrangements have been made with Walter D. Kelly Funeral Home and Cremation Centre. Cremation has occurred with a private, grave side service led by Sister Barb Vaughan being held on Thursday, September 3rd at Heavenly Rest Cemetery. A tree will be planted at Heavenly Rest Cemetery in her memory, as well, hundreds of trees will be planted in Gayle's memory throughout Essex County by members of the Essex County Field Naturalists' Club!

As a young man, David also loved jazz and big band music. In his early twenties he played tenor saxophone in a band that performed at the old pavilion near the Lakeshore Tavern in Kingsville. In 1963, David graduated from the University of Windsor with a B.A.Sc. in Civil Engineering. During his more than thirty years as a Professional Engineer he became a partner and director in the firm of LaFontaine, Cowie, Buratto & Associates Ltd. (successor firm of C.G. Russell Armstrong).

A beloved husband of 40 years to Edie (Miller) and father of Erin, Jay & Lynn (Bianculli). Dear Son of Irene and the late George Curtin (1980) and son-in-law of the late Gladys (1986) & David (1991) Miller. Close brother-in-law to Herb & Connie (Debernardi) Miller. Wayne was just getting to know his two granddaughters from New York, Laura Faye and Charlotte Rose. Wayne is also survived by his Aunt Yolande Boutette, Ann Loiselle, cousins Rusty & Darlene Loiselle, many nieces and nephews. Wayne was a high school teacher from 1967 - 2001. He received his B.A. at the University of Windsor in 1965, and a B.P. E. in 1968 and went on to get his Masters in Physical Education in 1969 at Eastern Michigan University. Wayne taught at W.D. Lowe, Vincent Massey, Centennial & Forster. He was Vice Principal at J.L. Forster & Western S. S. He coached at all schools, volleyball, basketball, and track and field. He was the assistant Basketball Coach with Paul (Doc) Thomas and later Mike Havey, he was interim head Basketball Coach at University of Windsor for the 1990-91 season. Wayne did not keep track of his successes but probably posted over 300 victories at the high school level. Through his career Wayne's senior boys' & senior girls' basketball teams won five Windsor Secondary School Association and four SWOSSA championships. Three of his teams have been OFSAA (all Ontario) silver medallists. Wayne could remember every play of every game. After retiring in 2001 Wayne was a clerk with Superior Court. He enjoyed his second career & the people he met in this new role. He also became one of the assistant coaches with the St. Clair College Saints. Wayne's other passion was travel and was always planning his next trip. Those that knew Wayne well knew his dry wit and often-biting comments but these were only directed at the ones he cared about. Along with his family there are special people that have been a huge part of Wayne's life for many years: Jane & the late Rick Boyd, Mike & Kathy Gloster, Marylou and the late Barry Halliwill, Linda & Doug Fraba, Carol & Bob Turner, Barb & Dexter Robinson, Steve Rogin, Angela Kaye. The Thursday night Basketball Guys and his golf league buddies cheered him up over the course of his illness with many calls and visits. Wayne fought hard and played to win, but could not defeat the onslaught of cancer. It was definitely not the coaching staff: We will be forever grateful to staff at the Windsor Regional Cancer Centre, the nurses at Metropolitan Hospital 4 West, Dr. Mathews, oncologist, and his assistant Ann, and Dr. Gall & the Hospice team. Finally we have to thank CCAC and the caring help from the St. Elizabeth team.

While still grieving the death on July 30 of Gloria, his devoted wife of 52 years, he too was diagnosed with cancer. He passed away peacefully at Hospice Village on November 21 at the age of 77 with his family by his side. He is survived by three children, Jocelyn (Paul) Gignac of Tecumseh ; Scott (Tracy) of Edmonton, Alta., and Julie Morgan of London; four grandchildren, Jacqueline Gignac who recently accepted a teaching position in South Korea; Andrea Gignac of Tecumseh; and Carter and MacKenzie Morgan of Edmonton; niece Christine (Andrew) McKelvie and family of Windsor; nephews, Dr. Todd (Charlene) Plexman and family of Sudbury and Matthew (Sylvia) Plexman and family of Toronto; brother-in law to Fred and Anne Plexman of Windsor. He was predeceased by his mother Christine Mayotte and aunt Florence Greig. He began a distinguished newspaper career in 1950 when he joined the Trenton (Ont.) Courier Advocate as a junior reporter. He moved on to the Sudbury Star in 1952 where he was appointed district editor before joining The Windsor Star in 1955 as a reporter. It was in Sudbury that he would meet his future wife Gloria. Except for one year in the public relations department of Union Gas in the early sixties, he would remain at The Windsor Star until his retirement as Editor in 1992. Before being named editor in 1977, he held a number of key positions in the newsroom including assistant city editor, city editor and news editor. While editor, he was involved in a number of community outreach programs, introducing an annual creative writing and poetry contest for area students and launching the Windsor Star Summer Camp Fund. He was a founding member of the Windsor Press Club and the Windsor Media Council, Canada's first community-based press council. He was a member of or actively involved with several professional organizations including the American Society of Newspaper editors, the Canadian Press, the Canadian Daily Newspaper Association and the Asian Pacific Foundation. He served on the advisory committee of the Ryerson University Journalism Department and participated in the editor/professor exchange program at Humber College. As a reporter, he won three feature writing awards in the Ontario Newspaper Awards competition held annually . After his retirement, the ONA committee named its award for special projects the Carl Morgan Award for Special Projects, which was a great source of pride to him, particularly when it was won by The Windsor Star. Following his retirement, he was involved in a number of community organizations and endeavors. Both he and wife Gloria were tireless volunteers for Hospice. When Gloria went through her first round of cancer treatments, he wrote a booklet entitled Man-to Man, a practical guide for male caregivers who were also dealing with the trauma of their wife's struggle with breast cancer. He was also involved in the fund raising project for the University of Windsor's new medical school. He always had an abiding interest in writing fiction and earlier this year had his first work, Belfast Brotherhood, published after 18 months of burning the midnight oil to complete the work. Prior to that he was involved in the writing and production of three non-fiction coffee-table books, including Birth of A City, Pioneering the Auto Age and The Olympians Among Us each of which focused on specific aspects of Windsor's history. Earlier on he wrote Early Woodenware in Canada which spotlighted another passion--collecting antiques particularly those crafted from wood. Carl had a wide variety of interests including photography, gardening, antiquing and travel.

Born in Lockeport, Nova Scotia on October 21, 1939 and educated there and at the American School at Kodaikanal, India, Marilyn came to Windsor's Metropolitan Hospital in 1957 and became a Registered Nurse. In Windsor, she met Sandy Wilson, the love of her life.

Marilyn's zest for life won her a host of friends from all walks of life and especially through the building with Sandy of their company, Splendor Pools, and through her church. Her memory also will long shine brightly with all of them. Marilyn was a devoted Christian. Her faith inspired the kindnesses that she will be so well remembered for and was a great comfort to her in her illness. The family is grateful for the many kindnesses shown to Marilyn and to them during her illness. They especially acknowledge the kindnesses of the Hospital's caring oncology department doctors and staff and the doctors and staff of the several other departments that contributed to her care.

May 7, 1963 - March 13, 2006 It is with great sorrow and sadness that we announce the passing of Arden. Born in Hong Kong, Arden and his family moved to North Vancouver in 1973, where he attended Handsworth Secondary School. He was one of the few Canadians who was selected to be a Page in the House of Commons while attending Carleton University for his Bachelor of Arts degree. Arden always considered it an honour and privilege to be a Page during a time of all night sittings in the House of Commons. He was a part of the repatriation of the Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and was often seen alongside Pierre Trudeau, Joe Clark, Brian Mulroney, Perrin Beatty and Jeanne Sauve. Arden thereafter attended the University of Windsor, Faculty of Law where he met Kimberley, her very first day of law school. True to his fun-loving nature, Arden was dressed for the semi-formal event in running shoes, gym socks, shorts, cumberbund and full tuxedo. Arden obtained his Bachelor of Law degree in 1987, however, before departing Windsor, he became engaged to Kimberley six days after their first date. Arden returned to his roots in British Columbia and set up his law practice in Ladner, British Columbia where he was joined shortly thereafter by Kimberley, marrying in 1989, and practicing law together until 2002 when Arden became ill. Always believing that it is important to give more to one's community than to take out, Arden was actively involved in a number of volunteer activities in his community, despite a full time law practice, such as being Director and Chair of Delta Youth Services and Crime Prevention Society, a founding member of the Kids for Success Camp for young boys at risk, a member of the Rotary Club of Ladner serving as Treasurer and President, a volunteer for the Delta Hospital Foundation, a volunteer guest instructor for the People's Law School and Continuing Legal Education and Board Member for the Kirkland House Foundation. His passion was offroading and he was a founding member of the Border to Border Expedition Society since 1998. He traveled to Mexico, across North America and to the Arctic Circle with his group of Land Rover buddies, seeing and appreciating the beauty of North America and the depth of friendships while on these annual treks. The dirtier the vehicle became, the more it got stuck in mud, the more it smelled and the more stickers that he placed on his vehicle, all were seen as proud badges of honour. Arden's proudest accomplishment and biggest passion in his life were forever his girls. With the arrival of Kelsey in 1992 and Morgan in 1996, Arden was always involved with his girls. Friends often said that even after 14 hour long days during his annual treks, as soon as he pulled in for the evening, the most urgent and pressing matter in his heart was that he had to call "the girls". His girls were his life and his passion his entire life, and we are blessed that despite the years that they spent with their Dad were cut short too quickly, we know that his spirit, love for life, mischievous nature, and commitment to his community are all attributes that his daughters proudly possess. Arden is survived by his wife Kimberley, his daughters Kelsey (13) and Morgan (9); parents Christopher and Virginia and his brother Bernard of Vancouver; predeceased by his sister Carol; and survived by his inlaws in Toronto and family throughout the world. Prayer service will be held on Friday, March 31st, at 7:00 pm and Christian Burial Mass will be held on Saturday, April 1st, 2006 at 10:00 am, both at Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church, 3900 Arthur Drive, Delta, British Columbia. Interment will follow at Boundary Bay Cemetery. A reception will be held at Beach Grove Golf & Country Club, 5946 12th Avenue, Delta, British Columbia. Knowing his zest for offroading and never treading lightly, the family graciously declines flowers. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Delta Hospital Foundation, 5800 Mountainview Blvd., Delta, British Columbia, in honour of Arden, and shall be designated towards the construction of the new Chapel and Sacred Space at Delta Hospital. Arden believed that if you can imagine it, you can achieve it. If you can dream it, you can become it. Indeed you did it all Arden. We love you a whole bunch plus one....forever.

Died peacefully in Windsor at Metropolitan Hospital in the presence of her loving family. Predeceased by husband Ron Morgan and her brother Wallace Horn. Survived by sister Dorien Sweeney of Windsor. Also survived by her first husband, John Johnston Baker of London and their four children Susan Baker-Eason (James Eason), Robin Baker (Les Voakes), Laurel O'Connor (Kevin), James Baker (Joanne). Also survived by grandchildren Stephen Eason, Kaven and Tallis Baker-Voakes, Brennan Baker and Rory O'Connor. Great grandchildren Victor DeRose, Anastasia, Alexander, Nicholas Eason. Marjorie was born in Windsor, literally at the old Devonshire Race Track, to Harry James and Annie Catherine Horn (nee Lee). She enjoyed childhood summers with her family in Stoney Point, Ontario. One of the most treasured experiences of her life was when she served with the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. When the war ended, she criss-crossed Canada, from Halifax to Vancouver, to greet war brides from Europe, and arranged to reunite them with their husbands. After the war, she married John Baker, and settled in Windsor where they raised their children. She worked for Fabco, Post Paper Box, and taught adult education. Later she started her own business in the Norwich Block, Marjorie Baker Commercial Enterprises. Often her friend and favourite politician Honourable Herb Gray would stop by to chat. Marjorie left a lasting & loving impression on many foster children that she welcomed into her home. After graduating from the University of Windsor and O.C.E., she taught law and business at Brennan High School, and always spoke fondly of her former students. Prior to her retirement she sold real estate. Marjorie loved travel, fortune telling, the horses and Vegas casinos. She loved a good party and more so, enjoyed cooking and baking for them. She rarely missed a New Year's Eve at the Top Hat with her colourful sister Dorien. She was considered a very lucky person and those who knew her have many stories of her sixth sense when it came to matters of gambling. She was a member of the Moose Lodge, the Royal Canadian Legion and the CNIB. We used to say that Marjorie knew everyone in the City of Windsor. She was also known for her strong independence and lived her life exactly the way she wanted to. Friends may call at the Walter D.

Born in the parlour at Lot 71, Con. 1, King Township in May 1920 to Jemima (Ireland) and Arwood Harman, Mae was the beloved younger sister of the late Leonard Harman. She attended Temperanceville Public School and Aurora High School, and participated in many youth rural reform efforts of the 1930s. In 1942 she left home for Victoria College at the University of Toronto. Upon graduating in 1946 she began her social work career at the YWCA at Winnipeg. In 1950 she returned to University of Toronto to earn a MSW, and after some years as a Branch Director with the Toronto YWCA, she took a position running junior and teen programs at the University Settlement. She remembered these years as "the happiest and most productive years of [her] professional life." Mae served as Executive Director of the Ontario Association of Professional Social Workers from 1967-1973, and in 1973, she was appointed to the School of Social Work at the University of Windsor. Upon her retirement in 1985, Mae returned to Toronto, where she bought a house that she filled with mementos of her many travels and friends. She took great pleasure in her neighbours and her cats, and she embarked on a second career as a volunteer advocate for social justice. As a member and then President of Canadian Pensioners Concerned, Ontario Division, and in connection with many other organizations and committees, she spoke out with passion and intelligence on many health and social policy issues. She received numerous awards for her volunteer service and advocacy efforts, including the Arbor Award from University of Toronto and the Dan Benedict Award from the Ontario Coalition of Senior Citizens' Organizations. Mae is admired and fondly remembered by her niece Joan (Harman) Murray and husband Timothy Murray, and her great nephew Peter Harman Murray.
